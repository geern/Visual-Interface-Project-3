1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Brain:,Maybe he's not as rigorous as everyone says.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,Prunella had him last year. Let's ask her.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Prunella:,"[laughs] ""Is the Rat bad?"" Does a bull fight? He eats nails for breakfast..."

1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Prunella:,And make sure you never answer any questions wrong... or he'll send you to death row.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Death row?
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,Have you done your math exercises?
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"I did the first 5000, sir."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"Then you have 9,995,000 left! Get to work! And after that, you have 37,000,000 spelling words to memorize. And you spiders, get moving!"

1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,He doesn't look so bad.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,It's probably a trick.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,Let's start with a two-minute math quiz to see what you remember from second grade.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,I told you it was a trick.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Mrs. Fink:,Welcome to the first day of school. School is cool! School is cool!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"Arthur Read, you'd better concentrate on those problems before time's up."

1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"Boy, Ratburn's tough! He gave us homework on the first day."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,"Get with it, Arthur. We're not dealing with a human being here. This is serious!"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,You find it yet?

1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,Shhh!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Uh-oh.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"Yes, I have all the eyes I need, but I'm completely out of heads. I need heads. I can wait for girls' heads, but I must have boys' heads immediately."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,"Wait, he'll see us! And we have... boys' heads!"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,There's no time! I need them now. I'll have to get them myself. [hangs up]
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,What are you doing?
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Ratburn. He—He's looking for body parts—heads! Boys' heads!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,You must have heard wrong. A vampire doesn't need heads.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,This is no ordinary vampire.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,He's beyond vampire.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,What's beyond a vampire?

1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Breakfast!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,What do you think he's gonna do with that saw?
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,I read a book where kids discovered a scary mystery like this and became detectives to solve it.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,We should probably investigate.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"You know, we have a lot of homework to do."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,You're just a fraidy-cat.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,"Arthur, we have to chose: face horrifying, scary danger or do our homework."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine and Arthur:,"Horrifying, scary danger."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,I'm bored. He's not doing anything weird. You probably heard him talking about heads of lettuce.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"Boy heads of lettuce? I don't think so, Francine."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Francine:,"Oh, yeah? It's probably the term grocers use for the rotten ones. I'm gonna do my homework."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,"Arthur, look!"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,[afraid] M-Maybe we should go do our homework.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Come on.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,He went into the carnival.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,Of course he went into the carnival. Look at all those boy heads!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,We've got to warn them.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,"Oh, no! He's got us! We're trapped!"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Look! There he goes! Come on! He went into that booth.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"Okay, it was that one."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Mr. Haney:,"This is very authentic, Mrs. MacGrady, but I'd prefer a real action pose."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"Sorry, sir."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,"Okay, I pick this time."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur and Buster:,One... two... three... go!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Run away!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,You're not safe! He'll get you!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"[as Jack] Hey, you're not in this story."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Puppet radio:,"And you're doing my lines! I warn Jack to run away, but not till he hears ""Fee-fi-fo—"" you know the drill."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"Arthur, Buster, get off the stage! [in Jack's voice] Okay, fellas, when you leave that castle, make a left, down that beanstalk, and you'll be back in Elwood City."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,Wow! The Rat does kids' puppet shows?
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Puppet radio:,"Jack, you're disorganized. You'd forget your head if it wasn't attached."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,[as Jack] Uh-uh! Would not!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Puppet radio:,Grab your head and hide! Here comes the giant!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Buster:,"Arthur, look!"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Giant:,Fee-fi-fo-fum!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Audience:,Ew! Gross!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,[inspecting his damaged puppet head] They always crack when I do that. I must go through 50 boy heads a year.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur and Buster:,Boy heads!
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,I can never have enough boy heads.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,We didn't know you made puppets.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"[reassembling a head for Jack] Can't talk, boys—I have 40 seconds to get Jack ready. Must always stay on schedule because of all I do."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"You do a lot! You're a teacher, a coach, you work on the school paper... [laughs] I can't even find time to do my homework and eat!"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,You need to learn to organize your time. I've heard that some people think I give a lot of homework.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur and Buster:,We never heard that.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"But once you've learned good work habits, you'll discover—"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Puppet radio:,Jack! Where are you?
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,[as Jack] Just a second! The cat rolled my head into the litter box. [to Arthur and Buster] You're capable of more than you think. I'll teach you how to do that homework and then have more time for things you enjoy.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,Like how you do all that stuff plus puppets?
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"Exactly. [checks watch] Ah! Two seconds early. Self-discipline is as important to learn as two plus two. [as Jack] Okay, I got my head on straight! [goes back on stage with Jack's head backwards]"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Puppet radio:,"Hey, man, your head's on straight, but your body is backwards!"
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,Please don't stand there. I have to concentrate on my work.
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Arthur:,"Oh. Sorry. [to Buster] Boy, were we wrong."
1,Arthur and the Real Mr. Ratburn/Transcript,3,Ratburn:,"By the way, boys, I can't wait to see your Geography projects tomorrow."
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Arthur:,Do you think everybody gets nervous before they do something that's really important to them?
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Francine ):,"Benjamin, do you think you should do this?"

1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Arthur:,I...N...
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Prunella:,Forget it.
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Arthur:,It's a good thing the third grade isn't depending on ME to win.
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Nigel Ratburn:,"Quiet, please. Everyone, get your homework out, so I can collect it. An important announcement, people: on Friday, we will have a spelling test."
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Mr. Ratburn:,"It will be a spell-off in Spellathon style. Study very hard, because the winners get a special surprise."
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Francine:,What do you think the surprise is?
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Buster:,Maybe the winner doesn't have to do so much homework for the rest of the year.
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Brain:,"If it means less homework, I want to win. I'm going to study extra-hard."
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Francine:,"Me, too."

1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Brain:,Antidisestablishmentarianism. I can never remember if it has five I's or six.
1,Arthur's Spelling Trubble/Transcript,4,Mr. Powers:,"Maybe you should just skip down to ""antidote""."

1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Mrs. Read:,"What's the matter, sweetie?"
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,D.W.:,[sighs] I'm bored.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Mrs. Read:,Ten minutes: that's all I'm asking. She needs someone to play with.

1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Arthur & Buster:,All right!
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,D.W.:,[glumly] But you'll have to play with me again later.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Arthur & Buster:,Okay.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,D.W.:,"Daddy, can't you make them stay on the beach?"
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Mr. Read:,I think it would be easier if you went into the water.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,D.W.:,I can't.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Francine:,[holding Buster's cap] Look what I found.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Buster:,"Hey, gimme that!"
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Muffy:,Get this disgusting thing away from me. It looks like a dead octopus. [throws it back]

1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Lifeguard:,Wasn't that fun? Now don't let them tease you anymore. There aren't any octopuses here. [to Arthur and his friends] I hear you've been having some kind of trouble.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Buster:,"Who, us?"
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Lifeguard:,Weren't you just yelling for help?
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Arthur:,We were only fooling around.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Lifeguard:,"Well, no more of that. It's dangerous to yell for help unless you really mean it. [to Buster] And you..."

1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Jane:,We'll see.
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,D.W.:,"I love the beach. Did you see me float? And I learned to swim, and the lifeguard gave me a ride, and she said that octopuses don't like lakes, and she's never even seen one!"
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Jane:,"That's nice, honey. We'll come back another time, okay?"
1,D.W. All Wet (episode)/Transcript,5,Jane:,"O-okay? [realizes she is asleep, turns to Arthur and Buster] Shh..."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"[to audience] You know how people get carried away with things sometimes? Like when D.W. played ""Hippo Hunt"" for four days straight?"

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,What about the brushes?

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,Follow me.
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,This is Ranger Ruth. She's going to tell us a thing or two about fossils before we go out and explore for ourselves.

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Class:,)
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,Don't you look like a smart bunch of boys and girls. Can any of you tell me what a fossil is?
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,You with the ears!
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"It's the calcified remains of ancient organisms. Minerals seep into their tissue and harden, preserving the forms of their bodies."

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,QUIET!
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Thank you. Now usually, the bodies would rot away. But very, very rarely, the hard parts of the bodies like shells and bones would last."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Many years later, this whole area was covered by the sea. Over millions of years, the soil turned to rock, and the bones and shells turned to rock too. Then the sea dried up, and a hundred million years later, the result is--"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"So, who wants to go on a fossil hunt?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Class:,Yeah!
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"Man, I can't wait to get my hands on one of those fossils!"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,I like the models better. I like to see what the dinosaurs really looked like.
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"Yeah, but there's something about a fossil. I mean, it's the actual thing, you know? The actual bone of something that was alive millions of years ago!"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Listen up, everyone! You see the layers in this rock? [points to the cliff] Each layer was formed at a different time. The ones at the bottom are from the Cretaceous period, which was... [motions to Buster]"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,A hundred thirty-six million years ago!
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Muffy:,[scratches her head] How are we supposed to get fossils out of a cliff when all we have are these little buckets? [holds up a plastic bucket she was given]
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Oh, you kids aren't hunting in the cliffs. That's for real paleontologists. You kids get to hunt in the stream!"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Francine:,"In the stream? Alright! [is the first to get in the water] The water's great! [takes a rock out of the water] Hey look, I found a fossil! Oh, no, wait. It's a rock. Hey, here's one!"

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,There are fossils here. You can drink soda anytime. [keeps looking in water]
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"[annoyed] Buster, come on! What do you expect to find in ten more minutes? You think you're just gonna reach into the water and pick one up?"

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"Found what? Let me see. I found it first. [takes a look at the fossil] Oh, wow, it's a leaf fossil!"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"[enraged] A leaf fossil? A LEAF fossil?!? Have you ever seen a leaf that thick? [calming down] Arthur, this is... a footprint."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Alright, let's all go around and talk about the fossils we found."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,The Brain:,We managed to recover what seems to be a fossilized shell. [hands the fossil to Ranger Ruth]
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Well, alright! It looks like a marginella. [puts it in a bag]"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,Wait! You mean we don't get to keep them?
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Oh! Didn't I explain? We put the fossils in the museum, so other children can come and see them. If people took them all home, there'd be none left. Who's next?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Francine:,We didn't really find any fossils. We found some neat rocks!
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"[thinking, silently] I can't believe it. I can't believe they would do that to me."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,That's okay. I'm sure you tried hard. Next?
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"Uh, we didn't find anything either."

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"Well, that's the way it goes sometimes. )"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"It's okay, we had fun anyway."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,[whispering again] We're never gonna get away with this.
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"But Buster, it isn't ours. It belongs in the museum."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"We found it, didn't we?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,But what if they search us on the way out? What if they have some special fossil detector alarm?
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,"[appearing in front of them, speaking to Buster] Hey, genius. I wanted to make sure you weren't too discouraged. You have the makings of a real paleontologist."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,She knows.
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,Don't be silly.
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Ranger Ruth:,Bye now! G'bye! See ya! Have fun! Goodbye!

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"So, who can we tell about the--the thing. Can we tell Francine?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,No! It's too dangerous. You have to keep ir a secret.
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Bitzi:,"Did you find any nice fossils on your field trip, dear?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"[nervous] Uh, n-n-no. Nothing in particular! )"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,[to Buster] So when can I come over and see it?
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,We can't take it out! It's too dangerous. What if my mom came in?
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"But Buster, what's the point of having it if we can't even take a look at it ourselves?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,"I hope everyone enjoyed our field trip, even if the fossils you found weren't as spectacular as actual dinosaur fossils."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,"But they are extremely rare. It would have been truly miraculous if you had discovered any dinosaur bones or teeth, or even rarer, dinosaur footprints."
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,[nervously] Who is it?
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Female voice:,Fossil police!
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"I'm sorry, Buster! They made me tell. They tickled me!"

1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"Keep it, I don't want it!"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"But I've gotta get rid of it. It's making me crazy! I thought it'd be so great having this million-year-old thing all to myself, but it's driving me nuts! And now I can't even look at it! [sets box down on ground]"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,It doesn't belong here.
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Buster:,"So, where does it belong?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"Hello, is this Ranger Ruth?"
1,Buster's Dino Dilemma (episode)/Transcript,6,Professor:,"[to Buster and Arthur] So, we're still not sure. Dr. Marsh thinks it's the footprint of a baby Daspletosaurus, but Dr. Cope thinks it's an adult Coelasaur."

I'll put it on you, because the story isn't on paper. But I do expect you to write that story down and hand it in first thing tomorrow."
1,Arthur Writes a Story (episode)/Transcript,23,Arthur:,"Yes, sir."

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,Any dog who does all the tricks Pal can do is very smart.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,I don't think so. She holds a dog treat. Roll over!

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Pal:,)
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"He doesn't even know to get a treat. I think he'd even starve if he had to be smart to get food. Here, watch this! Pal, sit up! Pal looks at her. See? Nothing!"
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,") I guess he's just not as smart as you, D.W."
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,I've been trying this for days and he never does a single trick!

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,I can hold Pal's leash.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,"I don't think so, D.W.."
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Mom, I'm old enough to hold the leash, right?"
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, let D.W. take Pal and you push Kate, please."
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,She must be hungry. Why don't we have lunch.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Maybe she's sitting on a bee. If I was sitting on a bee, I'd cry."
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,"What did you do, D.W.?!"
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,I didn't do anything! Your goofy dog escaped.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,"Pal! Pal! Come on, Buster, we have to find Pal."
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,"Hold it, boys. Let's make sure we get a table in the restaurant first so you'll know where to find us, then you can search."
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,Why not just get a new dog? Look at that dog's eyes. She points at a poodle. He looks intelligent. He'd never get lost.

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Clown:,"Achoo! Achoo! Come this way, kids. I have to get away from the dog. Achoo! He notices that Pal is sitting on his oversize clown shoe. He addresses a policeman. Can you get him outta here?"
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,You found a dog?
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Receptionist:,Yes. Arthur and Buster smile at each other. The receptionist puts a chihuahua on the table. Here he is.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur+Chihuahua:,Yeugh!
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,"Hey, do you think maybe Pal ran away because he doesn't like me anymore?"
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Buster:,"Arthur, it's time we broke up and started a full-scale investigation. You take this side of the street, and I'll take that side."

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,Thanks!

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Francine:,Arthur!
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,Hi! I can't talk.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Francine:,"I just saw your dog, he ran past the cinema."
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Muffy:,He was so rude. He was totally out of control. Arthur runs after Pal. How rude! It's easy to see where the dog gets it.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Francine:,We'll help find him.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Muffy:,We will?
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,There's Arthur!

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,He hates me.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,D.W.:,I told you I didn't let him go. He was escaping from you.

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Clown:,Ah... Ah... Ah... Achoo! ) Get away! Achoo! He lets the strings go. My balloons! Pal jumps on a chair and on the clowns head to get at the balloons. Get off me! A-a-choo!
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Clown:,You stupid dog! Come back with my balloons!
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Francine:,"It's Pal! Quick! They run after Pal. Pal, let go!"
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Muffy:,Why won't he let go?

1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Francine:,Huh?
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Muffy:,I told you he was a rude dog.
1,Arthur's Lost Dog/Transcript,24,Arthur:,"Why make lost dog signs if he doesn't want to come home? If that's what he wants, I want him to be happy."

1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,Ouch!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,I want that one.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur ):,"Some days, I wish he'd go south for the winter and stay there."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur ):,"Other times, I feel sorry for him. It’s bad enough being D.W.'s brother. Imagine what it’s like being her pet!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,") I guess I’ve grown used to him. In fact, I sort of like him. Spanky starts squawking. With his beak closed, that is!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Spanky, you sound sick. No school for you today. She feels the bird’s forehead. Hm, no fever. Still, you should stay warm. Now, how about a nice cup of tea?"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Spanky:,Chirp.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Wait here, and don't talk."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"This should do the trick! Mom made it with honey and I put in a cough drop, just in case."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Dad! Dad! Dad, why won't Spanky wake up?"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mr. Read:,"Oh, um... I think he's dead, honey."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Dead? Well, when is he gonna stop being dead? He has to drink his tea."

1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,Spanky's sleeping and he won't wake up.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,Oh.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Will he ever wake up, Dad?"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mr. Read:,"I'm afraid not, honey. Spanky's gone now. But we could give him a nice funeral."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"But I don't want Spanky to be dead, Daddy."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mr. Read:,"Spanky, I'll never forget the time you got loose in my kitchen, and you didn't eat a single poppyseed. Thanks."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mrs. Read:,"I'll always remember your beautiful song, Spanky."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Kate:,Ga.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"Gee, Spanky, I'm sorry I told you to shut up so much. And the time when you poked holes in my Bionic Bunny coloring book, I wasn't really angry. I was just pretending to be angry, because Buster was there, and when you..."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mr. Read:,Ahem!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"Well, I guess what I'm trying to say is, I'm gonna miss you, Spanky."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"I think, I'd like to be alone with Spanky for a moment."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"What the... Get out, whoever you are! This is Spanky's can now! A toad jumps out. Yuck! Oh, Spanky, I'll never have another friend like you! You were the sweetest, prettiest... The toad jumps over to her. Would you get out of here, you ugly toad!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"Don't be sad, D.W. You'll see, there'll be other fish in the sea... or birds in the air. Come on, I have an idea."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"How about this one, D.W.?"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,It looks just like Spanky.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,Wow! How about a parrot! It wouldn't remind you of Spanky.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Parrot:,Squawk! Spanky! Spanky!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,No.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"A hamster, now that would be cool!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,Does it sing?
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"No. That's what's so cool about it. A group of kids rushes past them. Hey, what's going on back there?"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Rat Boy:,They're about to feed the boa constrictor. It eats bird eggs whole!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,Don't even think of asking me!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Spanky, you'll be happy to hear that I didn't get another pet. Some of them were cute, but none of them were as cute as you. Not even the parrot, although he did speak English pretty well. She picks up the can. Hey, I thought I told you to stay out of that can, you toady-wartface! The toad jumps out. There are plenty of cans out there just as good as this one. Go away and find another one. The toad jumps back into the can. D.W. shakes it out. Hey, this is Spanky's can! Understand? Spanky's can, not toad's! You're just gotta go find yourself a new home!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Oh, hi, Billy and Bobby."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Billy+Bobby:,W..w... w-w-waaah!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Miss Morgan:,"Thank you for sharing that very pretty beach glass with us, Maryann. Now, does anyone have anything else for Show and Tell?"

1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Miss Morgan:,"Splendid, D.W."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"In this box are Spanky's things. He died, but he left this stuff behind. I don't think he'd mind if I showed it to you."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Kids:,Aaaahh!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,Get your disgusting hands off of that umbrella!
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Maryann:,Augh! The boy next to her tries to catch the toad. )
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Miss Morgan:,"Now, everyone, try to remain calm! The toad jumps on her head. Augh!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,Easy. I just tell him to get lost. Any more questions?
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"And then, Billy Biggles gave me a bite of his avocado sandwich. He's a vegetable-tarian."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mrs. Read:,Vegetarian.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Right, and it sort of tasted like a broccoli pudding. And then Amanda showed me her bottle cap collection. It wasn't that interesting. She drops the purse which fall into a gutter. And I told her she should get something more colorful, like pen caps, or candy wrappers, or leftover crayons, or ribbons off presents, or papers from the toys, or colored beads, or maybe straws from all over the world, or the things you pull off the sticky parts of bandages..."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"You again! Hey, how did you get my purse? You know pickpocketing is against the law, and if you don't watch you step, I'll call the cops on you! She picks up the purse. Ooah! I wonder if they dry-clean plastic? Hmph!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Dad, If I always pick up my socks and eat all my salad and brush my teeth without being asked, will Spanky come back?"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mr. Read:,"No, honey. But you know what, you have all those fun times you had with Spanky in your head. And whenever you miss him, you can remember one of those times. It'll make you feel better."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,Okay.
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mr. Read:,"Goodnight, pumpkin."
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Let's see. I remember the time I found that tiny top hat that fitted you just right? Oh, it's just not the same. She hears a noise. Huh? She sees a shadow in the birdcage. Spanky, it's you! I knew you'd come back! I knew it!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"That's it!! Stealing a purse is one thing, but trespassing on Spanky's property...that's bad!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,Oof. The toad sits on the nightstand. )
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"If I ever catch you in here again, I'm gonna...! The alarm clock rings. Huh. D.W. sees a ball out of the closet. Grrrr..."

1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Toad, you'd better not be in that can! Come on. I know you're in there! She picks up the can and yells into it. Come out, come out, wherever you...! Toad is not in the can. I hope I didn't hurt him!"

1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mrs. Read:,Why would there be a toad in the house?
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Well, he followed me every place yesterday, and last night I chased him into a pile of dirty... Oh, no! You're washing my clothes!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mrs. Read:,"Yes! And speaking of which, they were thrown all over the room!"

1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Arthur:,"A-hahaha! Evil Lord Konak, you'll never catch us now. We're safe within the castle. Toadie jumps through the castle and knocks it down. Unless, of course, a giant toad destroys it. D.W. runs through the castle and knocks down the remaining blocks. Hey!"
1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,D.W.:,"Wait! Come back, Toady! I'll be nice. I promise!"

1,"So Long, Spanky/Transcript",25,Mrs. Read:,"Well, I suppose. But we'll have to go to the library to find out how to take care of him. Toadie snatches a passing fly. Yuck!"

1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"Hello. May I speak to Mrs. Baxter, please?"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mrs. Baxter:,"What?? Buster Missing? But I just spoke with him! Yes, he's miniature golfing with his new friend Mike! Oh, is that all? Arthur, don't scare me like that."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,His new friend Mike? Who's Mike?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"So, where were you yesterday? I missed you. I-I mean, you missed Bionic Bunny."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Yeah, I went mini-golfing with my new friend Mike. He got a hole in one. Hoho, it was great!"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Yeah? Who's Mike?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Oh, Mike's great! He's the best mini-golfer I've ever seen! And he has lots of cool CDs. Everyone who knows him thinks he's really cool!"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Maybe the three of us could do something together sometime.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Yeah, maybe Mike could help us out on our science project. I bet he knows a lot about magnets."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Okay. Bring him over to my house after school.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,Great.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mrs. Read:,I brought up a snack for you and your friends.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"Thanks, Mom. They should be here any minute."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mrs. Read:,Have a good time.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"So, if the magnetic field goes out sideways from the poles of the magnet..."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mrs. Read:,Arthur? What happened to Buster and Mike?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,I guess they must have forgotten.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mrs. Read:,"Oh, dear. Well, it's almost time for dinner."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"Okay. I'll be down in a minute. Yeah, I bet they forgot."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mike:,Repeat after me: I will not go over to Arthur's house.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,I will not go over to Arthur's house.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mike:,I will never visit Arthur again!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,I will never visit Arthur again!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,Arthur? Arthur! She snaps her fingers in front of his face. Anybody home?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Sorry. I was just wondering where Buster is. He never seems never around anymore.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,Tell me about it!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine ):,He was supposed to be the catcher for us the other day. But he never showed up.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,I'm not getting it. You get it!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Brain:,Forget it!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,"When I asked him why he didn't show, he said he was with his friend Mike."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Muffy:,That's nothing! You know how Buster's such an expert on bikes? Well...
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Muffy ):,"He was supposed to help me at the bike store to help me pick one. But he never showed up, so I just had to buy them all."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,What a drip!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Brain:,I recently had a similar experience involving Buster.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Brain ):,I arranged to play Spacefighter 9 with him over the internet. He was to dial into my computer at 5 o'clock. But he never did.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Muffy:,So what?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Brain:,"Well, it's much less fun on your own."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,Whatever. The point is what are we gonna do about it? We can't just let Buster keep ignoring us like this.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Muffy:,How about we give him the silent treatment?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,I don't know. The silent treatment is pretty harsh. Arthur?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Buster needs to learn how it feels to be ignored. Let's try it.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Hey guys! Man, that food line sure is long. I'm starved! I barely had dinner last night. Mike and I went bowling and I just had a burger and shake. Mike taught me all these great tricks. Did you know if you spin the ball sideways, it gives it more force so it knocks over more pins? Of course, you have to be pretty strong, like Mike, to bowl that way. Tonight, we're gonna go to this great science fiction movie Mike told me about where all these people get eaten. Man, I'm hungry. I'm gonna go get some more food. See you guys later!"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Francine:,"Well, we sure taught him a lesson."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,I think we need to take more drastic action.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Hey, buddy. I guess we have to give a progress report on that science project today, huh? Magnets are such a great thing to do a project on! I bet we'll have the best project in class."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"Every magnet has a north and south pole. As you can see, north poles attract south poles and vice versa."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Ah, oh!"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Class:,)
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mike:,But what if I have a more powerful magnet?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,Mike? He is pulled against Mike's magnet. )
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mike:,"And, what's more, the magnets repel each other."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,) Correct. The larger magnet sends him flying through the air until he lands in a basketball hoop. Yaaaah! Oof.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"So what do you think our project should be, exactly. We haven't done much work on it yet."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Who hasn't done much work?! I've done plenty of work while you were out bowling with “Mike”!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,You have? I...
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"I don't wanna work with you anymore, Buster! I'll finish the project myself!"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"But... but, Arthur! I... we have to give a progress report."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mr. Ratburn:,"Good morning, everyone. I'm sure you've all been working very hard on your science projects. Most kids look uneasy, except Brain. And, as you recall, today I'll be asking you each to describe your project and what you've done so far. So, to start it off, Buster?"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Well, I was gonna be...uhm... I don't really know... what I'm doing."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Class:,)
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Mr. Ratburn:,"I see. Buster, perhaps you and I should have a talk after class."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,Oh.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,)
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,D.W.:,You can't throw those things out. They belong to Buster!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Okay. You can do it. Just twelve more blocks to Buster's.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,"Er... hey, Arthur. Listen, I'm sorry about the science project. I didn't realize I was letting you down."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Okay.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Buster:,Huh?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,It's okay!!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,)
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Hm.
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"So then, whatever metal the magnet is touching turns into a magnet too!"
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Yeah. Okay. Bionic Handshake?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Four-thirty!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Arthur+Buster:,Bionic Bunny!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Ed Billings ):,"Thank you for saving our farms, Bionic Bunny."
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Journalist ):,But who are you really?
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Bionic Bunny ):,Just someone who's trying to do the right thing in a mixed-up world!
1,Buster's New Friend (episode)/Transcript,26,Journalist ):,He's so cute! (sighs)
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"If you examined history, I bet you'd find kids like me did important things."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Read:,Tut! Tut! I asked you not to play too close to our new sphinx.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"I'll be careful, Papa Pharaoh. He hits the ball against the sphinx's nose which breaks off. Heh heh... Oops!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur ):,There were kids like me in Ancient Greece too.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Haney:,"No, sorry. I don't like it."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Read:,Arthureus! I asked you not to play with your discus in my work area!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"I'm sorry, Fathereus."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Haney:,It's beautiful! I'll take it.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur ):,I bet there were even kids like me around in colonial days.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Aah!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"All those things became more valuable and important because of an innocent kid. So you see, D.W., one day this may be looked back on as an historic event."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,I bet you'll never forget it. Mooom! Arthur broke the window!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Mom, the Brain loaned me the computer game Deep Dark Sea. Can I play it on your computer?"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur+D.W.:,Oof!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,After dinner? Why not now?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Kate:,)
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"So, Mom, can I play on your computer now?"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,) Done!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Don't distract me, D.W."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,I won't.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,How do you play it?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"You search the ocean floor, and there's sharks and sunken stuff."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Computer:,“Sonar shows jellyfish coming your way.”
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,How do you win?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Kids say there's this thing that you find. Buster says, his cousin's friend's brother found it, and the computer gave him a number to call, and he won a lot of stuff. But he had to swear in blood never to tell what he found."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,Octopus!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"No, he didn't win an octopus."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,"No, Arthur! Octopus!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,You're distracting me! Go away!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,Doesn't know what he's looking for!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,Good night.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,This is still my first game.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I can't stop now! I just made it to the ancient rotting shipwreck.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Then I'd have to start all over. I'd better save the game right now.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Computer:,“I'll be awaiting your return to your mission in the deep dark sea.”
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Huh? He notices that the computer mouse is stuck to his palm. )
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,There it is... the thing.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Then I go around the sharks to the sunken hull...
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,What are you doing?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I was thinking about the game.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Where is it? Are you playing it yet?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Not yet. They run past Pal, who follows them. Last night, I got all the way to the sunken hull."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Wow! What's a sunken hull?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,A big old haunted ship. I saved the game so we can start from there.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,"With a head start like that, maybe we'll find the... thing."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Oh, no!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"Sorry, boys. I have to work on the computer today."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,But it's Saturday. It's your day off.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,I don't get a day off during...
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Tax season. I know.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Read:,)
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Now there's nothing to do.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,)
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Read:,Why don't you boys ride to the park? It's a beautiful day.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Yeah, that sounds fun."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,"Yeah, fun."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"Honey, I have to run to the office."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Can we use your computer?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,I'd rather you didn't. I'll be right back and I'll need it again.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Couldn't you just show it to me for one second?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I guess. Mom would never even know.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,"Arthur, what are you doing? Mom told you not to play on her computer."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,We're not playing. I'm just showing it to Buster. Go away.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,"If I go away, I'll probably tell Daddy. Besides, I want to watch."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Okay, you can watch. But be quiet."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Wow! Even the Brain didn't get this far.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,What's that?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I don't know.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Go to it! Maybe it's the thing!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,A treasure chest...
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I bet that's it. That's...
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur+Buster:,...the thing!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I think I won! We've got to open it!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur+Buster:,)
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur+Buster:,)
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,You wrecked it.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"No, I didn't! You knocked the keyboard off the desk!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Because you pushed my arm. Try turning it off and on again.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,"You killed it! Now Mommy will lose her job! Then we'll lose the house and live in the street, and Kate will get ammonia and we'll all starve!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"D.W., be quiet! I'm thinking."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,And it's your fault so you'd better fix it! Because I like living here!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Don't do that! You'll make it worse!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Maybe you'd better call your Mom.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I can't. She said not to play with it and now I wrecked it. I got it! Maybe we can fix it before she gets home.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,Maybe a rich family would adopt me. I'm cute.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Who'd know how to fix a computer?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur+Buster:,The Brain!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Brain:,"Sorry, boys, he's not home, but I got a hunch where you might find him."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Binky:,Huh?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"If I were Brain, where would I go?"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Ah. Somewhere brainy.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,What other brainy places are there for the Brain to go?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Brain:,Hi.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,We looked everywhere for you.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,Are you doing a physics experiment?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Brain:,"No, I'm skipping rocks. It's fun."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Wouldn't coming to my house and fixing a computer be more fun?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Brain:,"Aah! Yeah, sure!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Brain:,You know what the problem is?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,No.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Brain:,"Well, neither do I."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur+Buster+D.W.:,)
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Oh... He falls to the floor. I'm dead. Well, you know, I've always wanted to live in Australia."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,We're doomed! All my childhood happiness is behind me!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Buster:,"Gotta go, Arthur."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Brain:,Yeah. Nice knowing you.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"Hello, boys."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,I won't need my computer till after dinner so you can go ahead and play now.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Er...no...no, thanks."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,Are you sick? You don't look well.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"I'm going up to pack... er, do my homework."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"If I just tell her, what do you think she'll do to me?"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,Bad Arthur! Bad boy!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, dinner's ready!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,") I hope you enjoy your dinner, Arthur! This may be the last meal we ever eat because of you."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Read:,"Arthur, you hardly ate any dinner."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"Maybe you should go to bed early, honey."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Don't you want dessert, Mom?"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"No, thank you. I have to work."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Why don't we go have a game of catch?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"I'd love to, Arthur, when I have less work to do."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Mom! When was the last time we rode bikes together?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur. After tax season, we'll play, I promise."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,Mom!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"Please, I have to work!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,You can't. I wrecked your computer.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,"How? You didn't play on it, did you?"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Buster only wanted to see it, and you were gone, and it was just gonna be for a second, and... I'm sorry."
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,"I don't want to live in the street, Mommy! Please!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,Let's see what's wrong. She presses a button and nothing happens. This happens all the time. Did you jiggle the switch?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,D.W.:,We're not going to starve!
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,You could have just called me and asked for help instead of worrying.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,I thought you'd be mad.
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,Not mad. Disappointed. I'm forbidding you from playing on the computer for a week. Fair? Arthur nods. How do you play this game?
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Goodnight, Dad!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mr. Read:,"Goodnight, Arthur!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Arthur:,"Goodnight, Mom! Mom? Mom?!"
1,Arthur the Wrecker/Transcript,27,Mrs. Read:,Just a minute! I almost had the treasure chest opened. Arr. Those snakes are attacking! I'm surrounded! Get back! Get back!

1,Arthur and the True Francine (episode)/Transcript,28,Francine:,"Your turn, Muffy. Truth or dare."
1,Arthur and the True Francine (episode)/Transcript,28,Muffy:,Truth.
1,Arthur and the True Francine (episode)/Transcript,28,Fern:,"Okay, um, have you ever told a lie?"
1,Arthur and the True Francine (episode)/Transcript,28,Muffy:,"What kind of question is that? Me? Tell a lie? Not once in my whole life. Not once in the whole history of my life. Francine looks surprised, then sad. Not once in the whole history of my family's life. If you only knew how Crosswires feel about lying, if you knew how we suffered for our principles..."

1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,Gotcha!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"And that's how, a hundred and fifty years ago, your great-great-grandfather Gustav came to own this farm. And ever since then, this family has taken care of the farm, and taken care of it very well, thank you, without any meddling help from busybodies. A clock chimes. Well, time for bed."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur+D.W:,Aww...
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"Night, D.W."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Goodnight, Arthur."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Aaaahh! She runs to Arthur who is lying in bed. Arthur, my room is full of chickens!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"D.W., you're imagining things. Go to sleep."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,Come on! Come see! They're big and white and they smell funny!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"Ah, for crying out loud!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,See? Bed... desk... dresser... chickens?! There are chickens on top of a shelf and on top of a wardrobe. They wake up and start squawking. Huh?
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,Golly. Plumb forgot I put them there after the hen-house roof fell in!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,Arthur! Your foot is touching mine! They face different ways. Arthur looks unhappy. Let's tell Grandpa to fix the chickens' house tomorrow. I want my own bed.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"Yeah, me, too."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Mm-mm. Nothing like a bodacious breakfast to get your motor running. Well, let's get this day started!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"Hey, Grandpa. What if we go into town and get that lumber so you can fix the hen-house."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Oh... Well, I kind of thought today we could go fishing. I've got the poles and bait all ready."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,I guess that does sound like fun.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"I've got it, Grandpa!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Well, look at that! Whoa!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,Rocky road and chocolate chocolate chip. Your favorites.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"Thanks, Grandpa!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Will you buy that lumberware now, so you can fix the chickens' house?"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Still haven't fixed the hen-house, huh, Dave? You know, if you need a hand, I'm good with a saw."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Ed, the day I need your help is the day hens give milk! Our family has been keeping that farm neat as a pin for..."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"...a hundred and fifty years, I know. And that's about as long as that hen-house has needed a new roof!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,Ely? Where's that dang lumber I keep asking you for?
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Arthur, I'm cold. Close the window."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,I tried. It's stuck.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,We have to get Grandpa to fix this place up!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Hiya, Ed. Appreciate you taking the kids for the day. This hen-house is gonna be a lot of work."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Always happy to land a hand, Dave. Hey there, kids."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Hello, Ed."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Kids, I'm gonna have too much work to look after you today, so Ed here is gonna take you hiking on Mount Springle. Now, don't be disappointed..."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur+D.W:,Yeah!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Taking it kind of hard, aren't they?"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,Yes!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Faster, Ed! I want to get to the top."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Whoa, take it easy. We're already there!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,Wow! He has a great view of the surrounding area. I wish Grandpa were here to see this.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Oh, he's seen it often enough."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Ed, how come Grandpa can't keep the farm fixed up?"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Well, D.W., that's a funny thing. Now that your Grandpa's getting older, the farm's a lot for him to handle, but he's a real independent old-timer. Doesn't like to accept help from anybody. Trail mix, anyone?"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Alright, let's see this brand-new hen-house your grandpa built today."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Say, back already? It's not quite finished yet."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Grandpa, you didn't do anything!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Well, now, that's not true, D.W. I started out patching the roof. But then I realized, I'd have to replace two of the walls, first. But it turned out, that meant sawing some new joists, and... well, before you know it, it's time to call it a day."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,"Arthur, Grandpa needs help. He can't do it all himself."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"But he won't let anyone help him, D.W. You heard what Ed said."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,I don't care how independent Grandpa is. Someone has to help him fix the chickens' house.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"But we're on vacation! D.W. lies down and closes her eyes. Okay, okay, you're right. Tomorrow we'll help Grandpa fix the hen-house."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Okay, kids. Leave those dishes on the table. We're going to the fair!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,Hm-hm!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Arthur:,"Oops. Um, Grandpa, the fair sure would be fun, but..."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,Like what? Are you feeling sick?
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Horsefeathers. I can't make you two stay here and work, or what'll I tell your folks. And besides, this farm has been in our family for a hundred and fifty..."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,Grandpa! We are your family!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Oh, well, you have a point there. I guess I could use a couple of... assistants... for a while."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,Whoa.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,Whoa-oo.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"How about a little help on that roof, Dave?"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Okay, Ed. You win. But I don't want to be hearing about this all around town."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Well, what do you know? It took us two days, but we did it!"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,D.W.:,I want to build the chickens a shower of gold for their bathtub!
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,There'll be plenty of time for that on your next vacation.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Mr. Read:,"Hi, kids. How was your vacation?"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Mrs. Read:,"Gosh, Dad. There seem to be lots of other... little tasks around."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,There's no end of work on a farm.
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Ed Billings:,"Well, Dave, like I've been saying, I could give you a hand around here."
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Grandpa Dave:,"Ed Billings, this farm has been in our family for over a hundred years and... Arthur and D.W. exchange looks. ...it's about time we got some decent help around here. What do you know about tractor engines?"
1,Grandpa Dave's Old Country Farm/Transcript,30,Mrs. Read:,"We'll be back soon, Dad. Now you two, into the car."

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Please Mom! I'll be so rich that you and Dad will never have to work again!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"D.W., remember when you said that you wanted to play T-ball more than anything?"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,I could only hit balls that move.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,And when you wanted to be a ballerina?
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,I have weak knees.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,And how about the violin lessons?
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,I could have been really good if they didn't make me use that stick.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"D.W., you wanted to do all those things, but you didn't want to practice. Now why is this any different?"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,"Because I really, really want to do this one. Besides, Mom, I'm already good at jumping."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,) Alright! Huh?
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,"Oh, thank you Mom!"

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,"Hmph! It's Emily and her nanny! I'm in the same class with ""Miss Perfect""."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"Now, D.W., just because she's smart, pretty, and very polite, it doesn't mean she's perfect."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,"À tout à l’heure, Aimée. [Until soon, Aimée.]"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"Well, it looks like you're about to start. I'll be in the waiting room. Don't try anything too fancy, okay?"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Oh...
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Announcer #1:,"There's the pinwheel flip, with a frog kick follow through, and a having-tea dismount. Amazing!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Announcer #1:,"Well Bob, I guess it won't be long before we see that face on a box of Crunch Cereal."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Announcer #2:,"Yep! But let's not forget the runners up. Emily, uh, what's her name, not quite perfect, gets the silver medal."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Master of Ceremonies:,)
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Announcer #2:,And Timmy and Tommy Tibble receive the bronze. Although everybody knows they should've been disqualified.

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"Off that balance beam, young lady."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Ow!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,This apparatus is not for beginners. We won't be using it for at least a year!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,A year?! But I can't wait that long! I'll be old by then!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,Then you better start practicing right away. We'll start with a somersault.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,Then you tuck your head and roll. She rolls. And that's the somersault! Everyone find a partner!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,Be my partner?
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,I guess so.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Urg!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,"Pretty good, but next time grab your knees. Then you'll end up on your feet."

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,All wrong! You didn't jump high enough! The roll was too slow and you didn't smile at the end!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"Emily, that was lovely! Keep up the good work! D.W., next time, try holding your knees."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,I guess she didn't know you were doing a half-sault.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,)
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Kids:,)
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"Excellent posture! D.W., try to keep your back straight like Emily's."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,You think she'll teach us how to stand on the ceiling like that?
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Whoa!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Kids:,)
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"When you finish the cartwheel, make sure you bring your feet together. It looks simple, but it takes practice to get it right. Alright, Edwin, ready?"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Edwin:,") He walks hesitantly to the end of the mat. He stands on one hand for a moment, then falls down. Oof."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"A brave attempt, Edwin. Try to break the fall with your hands. Next!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,"One two three, one two three."

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Tommy:,I'll bet I know where she's going. She's going to her mommy!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Timmy:,"Yeah, because she's afraid of doing a cartwheel!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,I am not! I was just going to... to...
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"Well, Miss Read?"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Oof!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"Not bad, but do try to stay on the mat."

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Miss Morgan:,"Emily, showing off is very impolite!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,It's not fair!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,"I'm sorry I showed off, D.W."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,"I could've done a better one, but I didn't want to. Cartwheels are for babies!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,"Well, I think they're kinda hard."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Not as hard as doing a cartwheel on the balance beam. Bet you can't do that!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,Neither can you.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Oh yeah?! Well you just watch!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,Wait D.W.! )

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Tommy:,She's too scared to do it!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Whoa!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Kids:,)
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Timmy:,"Yeah, she's gonna chicken out!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Whoaaa! Am not! She nearly loses her balance. Whoa! )
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"D.W., what were you doing?!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,"Oh Mom, I was just doing a cartwheel."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"We'll discuss this on the way home, young lady! Now go put your shoes on!"

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Timmy:,Her?!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Tommy:,But she stopped you from doing a cartwheel!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Maybe you two would like to do a cartwheel on the balance beam! Hm?!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Timmy:,) Did you hear something?
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Tommy:,"Yeah, I think I hear Grandma calling us! Gotta go, bye!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,"Thanks D.W., you're a real friend."
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,"Well, after all, you did save my life! Maybe... maybe you could teach me how to do a really good cartwheel?"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,"Sure, but it takes a lot of practice!"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,I'll practice! If you promise not to be so perfect.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Emily:,It's a deal!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"And you could have hurt yourself very badly there, D.W.! D.W. looks out of the window. D-D.W., are you listening?"
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,I'm listening. I'll be careful.
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,Good!
1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Mommy??

1,D.W. Flips (episode)/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Oh please Mommy? I'll be really careful! Please? Please?! Pleeeeeease?!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,Francine's done some goofy things. Once she tried to break the world's hand-walking record and did everything on her hands.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Arthur, pass it here! She stands on her hands. I'm open."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"And once, she decided the best time to practice was on the roof at sunrise."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Woman:,The building's collapsing!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Man:,"No, it's somebody playing drums!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,That only lasted one day.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,And then there was the time she decided to make a life-size painting of an elephant... in her bedroom!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Mrs. Frensky:,Francine!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Mr. Frensky:,Not bad. Accurate proportions.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,But that wasn't the weirdest thing she's done. Last week Francine did something that nobody could believe.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,Hey! I'm on your team!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Yes! Cheer up, we're doing great."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,Who's we? Nobody but you gets to do anything!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Binky's team is tough! I'll gladly give you the puck if everybody want to lose!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"You're so rude, Francine Frensky!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,I guess the truth hurts.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"Muffy, shoot!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,No! Pass it to me!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Tough Customers:,)
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,We lost!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"I hope you're happy, Arthur."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,How is it my fault?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Why did you tell Muffy to shoot? You know she's just about the worst player that ever was. Muffy looks hurt. She turns around and skates the other way. We’re just lucky we have one more play-off game next week. Where'd Muffy go?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Wait up! You mad about something?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"Maybe I'd learn to play better if you actually gave me the chance to play! You take all the fun out of everything! You're like a walking, talking poke in the eye!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"I'm one of the nicest people in the whole school, and if you don't know that, you're a dope!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"I am, am I?! Well, I'll bet you this Princess Peach watch, that you always envied and admired, that you can't even be nice for one entire week!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,I bet I can!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"Okay, then. You have to be pleasant for one entire week, Francine, and you can't tell anyone why."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Why would I. They won't even notice a difference!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,Where did you get that weird sweater?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,My aunt Bonnie. My other sweater's dirty so I got stuck wearing it.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy+Sue Ellen:,)
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,Uh-oh. Watch out! Here comes Francine. You're never gonna hear the end of it.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Um, Arthur, that sweater..."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,A-hem!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Um...
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"What about it, Francine?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,It's nice. She walks off. )
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Two men in scoring position. Who's up?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,I am.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Buster, let me bat for you. She tries to take the bat. Muffy looks at her. Er, unless you'd rather bat. You just look a little tired. Feel okay?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,"Yeah, I'm fine. Do you feel okay?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Yes. Thank you for asking.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Brain:,Hey! You have to see this.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,What's she doing?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Okay. Now you try it. Muffy takes the hockey stick. She tries to skate and knocks over Francine. Ah! Muffy! Can't you do anything... ) ...wrong? That was near perfect.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,Weird.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,Has anybody else noticed something different about Francine?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Brain:,"Yeah, she actually replaced my football that she threw down the sewer last week."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Sue Ellen:,That's nothing. She came to my house to replace a glass of juice she drank last summer!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,My good pants!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,Sorry. Am I still invited over for dinner?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Rrrr... Yes. Muffy skates off. Francine starts kicking the wall. She ripped my good pants! Muffy looks around the corner. Are you as impressed as I am by the durability of brick?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"I'll be over at five-thirty. She leaves. Francine is about to kick the wall again, when Muffy comes back. There are three days, three hours and thirty-two minutes left in the bet. Wanna call it off?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Don't worry about me! Just take good care of my watch! Muffy skates to Bailey who is waiting with the limousine. Francine sits down on the ground. )
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,A-hem!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Father, let me help with those."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Mr. Frensky:,"Er, what? Who said that?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Catherine:,"Francine, you have a guest and you wear ripped pants? That's nice."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Yeah? Well, your clothes... She shakes. ...are great. Perhaps you could take me shopping some time."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Catherine:,"Finally, you display some taste! We'll go on Saturday."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"Francine's friendly, helpful, pleasant."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,"Arthur, I'm scared!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"We’re all scared, Buster. What are you doing?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Brain:,"Guys, this behavior is no good for Francine. Allow me to demonstrate. If someone with Francine's temper holds it in, the pressure builds, just like it build when you shake this bottle. The longer she holds her anger in, the more pressure builds up, until she reaches the inevitable point when the pressure is just too much."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,") As her friends, we gotta help her before she pops!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,How?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Brain:,We have to make her really lose her temper.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,)
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"It's an easy one. If we miss it, it'll drive Francine nuts."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Mighty Mountain Player:,Yeah! Hurray!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,We did it. She's gonna scream.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,I guess the sun was in your eyes.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"Francine, we already bought you a soda. Here."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Cherry?! This is cherry! Arthur, you know I don't like cherry! Muffy stands next to her. But perhaps I haven't given it enough of a chance."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,"Francine, Binky Barnes said he could beat you at any sport, any day."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,He did?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,Doesn't that make you mad?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Brain:,Aren't you going to beat him at a game and teach him a lesson?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Perhaps he's speaking boastfully because he's insecure... or he practiced very hard and really can beat me.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Brain:,We tried.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"With all the pressure that must be building up, she's definitely going to pop."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,And it could happen at any time.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Mr. Ratburn:,"“They very soon came upon a gryphon... a gryphon, a gryphon, a gryphon..."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Brain:,She's gonna sail clear to the next town!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"My, but it's a lovely day."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Dog:,"Wow! Mommy, some kid's head fell in our yard."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,What a beautiful lawn.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"Muffy, do you know what's wrong with Francine? You are her best friend."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,We're all worried she might pop.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"Don't worry. She'll be back to her normal, pushy self tomorrow afternoon at this time."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"You mean, right after the play-off game?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,The hockey game! I didn't consider the hockey game!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,Why didn't you steal the ball?
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,It would have been rude to ruin his concentration.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Oops! Excuse me.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Arthur:,"Francine, distract the goalie! Tell him something about his face!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,I don't wanna hurt his feelings.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Good shot, Sue Ellen. I never knew you guys played so well!"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Kiefer, you haven't scored a goal all season, have you?"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Kiefer:,"Hm, no."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,Take a shot.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Buster:,Francine!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,I'm just trying to be nice.
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,"Francine, there's only thirty-seven minutes left in the bet. I declare you the winner"
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"I can last thirty-seven more minutes! Besides, you were right. Everyone plays well if I'm nice."
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Muffy:,Everyone including the other team! Here's the watch. Now get mean!
1,Meek for a Week/Transcript,33,Francine:,"Thank you for the watch, but I feel it's only right I last the final thirty-seven..."

1,Arthur's Chicken Pox (episode)/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,"Arthur! This is about the night Arthur was born. Anyway, he never did get the car started, what with that busted carburetor, so I went in and called a taxi and, oh my, was I worried you'd be born right here in the kitchen!"

1,Arthur's Chicken Pox (episode)/Transcript,35,Mr. Read:,Hh!
1,Arthur's Chicken Pox (episode)/Transcript,35,D.W.:,I only wanted pox because I was jealous.    Both parents try unsuccessfully to hide their laughter.

1,Arthur's Chicken Pox (episode)/Transcript,35,Mrs. Read:,She must be running a fever.     D.W. runs up to Thora.
1,Arthur's Chicken Pox (episode)/Transcript,35,D.W.:,"Grandma, can I have all that stuff now? A tray and a bath and everything?"
1,Arthur's Chicken Pox (episode)/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,"Strangest case I've ever seen. Okay, D.W., you want a bath, you've got it!"

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Good boy! Now, what does a worm do? Pal rolls around on the floor. Pal hasn't been my dog for very long, but he's learned a lot from me already."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur ):,He learned that he shouldn't slip out of his collar during a walk.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"No, Pal! Heel! Heel! Stop! Sit! Stay! Wait!"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,I told you to heel!!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur ):,And he learned that Dad's garden hose isn't a chew toy.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"No, Pal, no! Look at all the teeth holes. Pal runs away and hides behind the corner of the house. Don't worry. I've fixed it so Dad will never notice anything's wrong."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,Oh! Arthur and Pal sit on the playground when they hear him. Arthur!!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Wanna go for a walk, boy?"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,Mom! Arthur's feeding pancakes to the dog!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,Just one little piece.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, you know Pal has his own food to eat."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,Done with this page?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,"Arthur, lunch!"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mrs. Read:,Arthur. What did I tell you about feeding your dog from your plate?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,I wasn't.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,Want to hear a good joke? Knock-knock... Pal grabs the hotdog and pulls her off her chair. Hey! The dog stole my wiener! The dog stole my wiener!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,Arthur! Tell Pal to let go!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,Pal! Let go!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,It's mine It's mine!

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,"Give it back! I don't eat your dog food, do I? Pal pulls her under the table. Oof. They play tug-of-war. Grr! I'll never let go! Never! Ow! Pal pulls the hotdog out of the bun and she falls backwards. Pal eats the hotdog. Someday I'm gonna teach that dog a lesson he won't forget!"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,") Surrender now, Bionic bubble brain! (as Bionic Bunny:) Never!"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal:,)

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,Mom! Dad! Mom! Dad!

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,That's it. See?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,"Let him rest, and if he doesn't feel better, we'll take him to the vet."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,And he might have to go to the vet.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Francine:,My aunt's chameleon escaped from the vet.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Francine ):,"He slipped out of his cage, changed to the color of the wall, slithered into the air vent..."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Francine:,...and he was never seen again.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Buster:,"Luckily, Pal can't change colors. Or slither into a vent."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Brain:,"Arthur, the vet will find out what's wrong. Vets know how to talk to pets."

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal ):,My tongue hangs out when I go: (groans).
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Vet:,You go )?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal ):,No: (groans)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Vet:,"Oh, I'll have to operate. He holds up a big, circular saw. Would you like a blindfold?"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Buster:,Maybe Pal will feel better and you won't have to go to the vet.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Yeah, maybe. Bye."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Come on, Pal, time for your walk. Pal opens one eye and sticks out his tongue. I said it's time for your walk."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Mom, Dad! Pal doesn't want to go for his walk! And that's his favorite thing!"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,I thought eating the hose was his favorite thing.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"What's wrong, boy?"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Nurse:,"Bring him right in to the doctor, Mr. Read."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Amazing Larry:,"Dog not feeling well, Arthur?"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,No.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Amazing Larry:,"I'm sorry. Victoria got tied in a knot. A snake in the chair beside him tries to untie itself. Ooh, don't force it, honey, don't force it."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Sue Ellen:,My snail's been acting sluggish.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Snail:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,What did the vet say?

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"But Dad, he's never been away from me. Ever!"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,It's the best way the doctor can treat him.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,"Come on, Arthur."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Don't worry, Pal. You'll be fine. Bye. He waves at Pal again, and he and his dad walk away. I must be allergic to something."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,Yeah.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,Look on the bright side. Now we can get a good dog.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,Mom!

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,Hmm.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,I want you to know I understand how you feel. I felt the same way when my bird died.

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,What? What did I say?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Brain:,I bet the vet finds out what's wrong and sends him home tomorrow. He gestures to Francine and Buster. Guys?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Francine:,Yeah! Right!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Buster:,Of course!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,I think D.W. did this to Pal.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Francine:,Are you serious?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,She always hated him!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Buster:,Let's call the cops and put her in prison!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Brain:,They won't do that. We learned this in school. She's innocent until proven guilty.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Francine:,Then we'll just have to prove her guilty first!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,I can't believe you want me to play with you. What are we playing?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"We're playing ""Courtroom""!"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,You're on trial. Brain's the judge. Brain takes out a book. Francine's your lawyer.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Buster:,"Hi, I'm the jury! Does the jury get snacks?"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Brain:,"Order in the court! D.W., you are accused of making Pal the dog ill."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,I'm what??
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,How did you make him sick?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,Why would I do that?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Buster:,"I know why. She's probably an alien replicant sent to Earth to get rid of our dogs in preparation for an alien invasion, because only dogs can tell who's an alien and who is truly human."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Brain:,Guilty!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Francine:,Where is the proof? My client is innocent until proven guilty!
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W:,This game's dopey. I quit!

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Vet:,They left this note when they broke out. No one knows where they went.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Pal, where are you?! Pal, where are yoouu?!"

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,"So, what was wrong with him, Arthur?"
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"I guess I made him sick by giving him things to eat. Dogs' stomachs are different than ours. I'm real sorry, boy."

1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Sorry I blamed you, D.W. It wasn't your fault."
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,Uh-huh.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,And I'll try to convince Buster you're not an alien.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,Apology accepted. Why would you think I would do anything to Pal?
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Arthur:,Because you said you'd teach him a lesson he wouldn't forget.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,Pal:,)
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,And I still plan to do that.
1,Sick as a Dog/Transcript,36,D.W.:,"I got this dog training book from the library. She gives the book to Arthur. Now you are going to read it to me, and I am going to teach him not to steal my food. And to do all the things normal dogs are supposed to do."

1,D.W. Rides Again (episode)/Transcript,37,Francine:,I don't think you can. A tricycle can't keep up with two-wheelers.
1,D.W. Rides Again (episode)/Transcript,37,D.W.:,I bet I can! I'm good.

1,D.W. Rides Again (episode)/Transcript,37,D.W.:,"Too flashy. One bike has a toothy mouth painted on the front. Too angry. A pink bike with wings. Too girly. A bike with a tiny front wheel. Well, that'll last about an hour before it breaks."

1,The Half-Baked Sale/Transcript,40,Grandma Thora:,"I can handle this. Cooking runs in our family, you know. In fact, your father started cooking when he was your age, Arthur."

1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur+Buster:,Hmm...
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur:,"Buster, your ears!"
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,)
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur:,What is that weird stuff? I don't see any people.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster: ,Kind of unearthly.

1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Weatherman ):,...because tomorrow will be cloudy and colder.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,) I know why we didn't see people in there. They're invisible!
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur+Buster:,)
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Mrs. Baxter:,The new family that moved to town sounds interesting. I want to interview them for the newspaper. Have you seen them yet?
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,"I don't think anybody's going to be able to see them, Mom."
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,We should go to the FBI before we go back to that house.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur:,"Before you spread a crazy rumor, I want to be sure."
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,"Crazy?! Ha! Like the idea of invisible people is crazy! Haha, right!"
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,"Arthur, how will we know if invisible people are chasing us?"
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur+Buster:,) A woman walks by. (breathe heavily) Arthur and Buster stick their heads through the snowdrift.

1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Brain:,She's weird and she's creepy. Nobody knows exactly...
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Prunella:,"When you're hiding out, you always go to a small town."

1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Mrs. Baxter:,I interviewed them yesterday for the paper. They're very nice.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,"Oh, they know I know, and they're coming to neutralize me."

1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,) Roast beef... mashed potatoes... raspberry pie... No! This may be a clever alien trap.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Sue Ellen:,You are the only human who knows our true identities.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Armstrongs:,)
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,) The bubble floats out into space. Oh man! Now Earth's enslaved because I couldn't control my appetite. Wish I'd brought some cookies.

1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur:,Did you see the article about Sue Ellen's family in the paper? They lived all over the world. That's why all their stuff's different.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,"You don't believe that, do you?!"
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur:,Your mom wrote it.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,My own mom fooled by aliens.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur:,"Hey, what smells so good?"
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,"That's the bait they're using. Hey, if you came to eat, we could guard each other and I could have dinner."
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Arthur:,You should bring things from the places you lived to class. All the kids would be interested.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Sue Ellen:,You really think so?
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Sue Ellen:,"My father's worked all around the world. The last place he worked was San Jose, the capital of Costa Rica."
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,How do you explain that you didn't know what snow was?
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Sue Ellen:,Costa Rica has a warm climate. No snow.
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster:,Hmm...
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Sue Ellen:,"Before, we lived in Nigeria. And these are kobo, the coins they use there. I'll pass them around."

1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Sue Ellen:,"My family wants you and your mom to come over for hot dogs. Arthur told me you love them, and I’ve never had an American hot dog."
1,Sue Ellen Moves In/Transcript,41,Buster: ,"Hot dogs? Ha, hot dogs? Okay! They've got me. They know I can't resist them. Oh well, maybe they're friendly aliens."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,I love having my friends come over.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"When Buster's here, I never have to eat leftovers the next day."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mr. Read:,"Arthur, don't forget to eat some peas."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Buster:,D'you mind? He eats the pea. Mmm...
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,There's none left. I wish Buster ate here every night.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"And when Francine visits... Well, let's just say, next to her, I look neat."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mr. Read:,Don't tell me. Francine was here.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"I wish my friends could live here, then everything would be perfect. He leans back in his chair and it tips over. Whoa!"
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,Is that a horse or a pig?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"D.W., go away!"
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, guess what. Alan's spending the weekend. His parents are going away."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"Alan? Alan who? Oh, you mean the Brain. Right. It'll be like having a brother. Somebody who'll do all the things I like. I always wanted a brother. He notices that D.W. is 
painting on his picture. Hey! Instead, I got stuck with two sisters."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,You're not stuck. You can leave at any time. And I'll take your room.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"We'll have all weekend to do great things, like build a time machine."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,You sure this is going to work?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"It will, as soon as I insert the nuclear core. Open the door. Arthur opens a small door and Brain drops the glowing object in. Okay, let's go."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"Let's go back in time! Around them, the Reads’ yard is replaced by a meadow, then an icy plain. What time d'you wanna go home?"
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"Huh? Don't know how to go forward in time, just backwards."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,You mean we can never go home?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur+Brain:,)
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,Or maybe we'll build something simpler.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,"Arthur! A fake spider hangs from the ceiling. Argh!! Mom! A big, hairy spider stepped on my face!"
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur+Brain:,)
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur ):,And we'll stay up late.

1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthurs:,)
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,Maybe I'll spend the weekend at Grandma's.

1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"Shall we do homework first, Arthur?"
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,Why? It's not due till Monday.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"If we do it now, we'll have the rest of the weekend free to read ahead for next week's lessons."

1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,You giving up?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,I'm done.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,Can I look at your answers?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"Yes, but you won't learn it unless you do it yourself."

1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,My game. Ready to play again?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,You beat me...thirty games to none. Maybe I'll go do my homework.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,Is it okay if I keep shooting? I shoot a hundred free-throws every night for practice.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,You weren't just born good?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,) No.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,Wanna sneak down and watch “Curse Of The Puppet's Sister” on TV?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,Wouldn't your folks be mad? I think we'd better sleep. It's while you sleep you grow.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,I'd rather be short and watch scary movies.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,"Look at this. While you were tying your shoes, the Brain taught Pal new tricks. Brain snaps his fingers and Pal walks on his hind legs. He snaps again and Pal crawls on his belly. Brain claps his hands and Pal picks up a piece of paper and throws it in the trashcan. D.W. applauds. I always thought that dog was dumb. I guess it was just you, Arthur."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,I'm done first. I beat you.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"Mr. Read, you could accomplish that much more efficiently."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mr. Read:,"That's fantastic, isn't it, Arthur?"
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"Yeah, Dad. Mayonnaise is wild. Let's play a game, Brain."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"This is my favorite game, but no one likes to play with me."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"See? When we delete these files, everything runs faster."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mrs. Read:,"That's great! Arthur, Alan just reprogrammed my computer."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"Oh, great. I'll be in the yard with the game."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,"""Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair."""

1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,And here she is putting all her hair out the window.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,She must use truckloads of shampoo to get that that silky shine.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"Hey, Brain, the game is set up."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,He can't play now. He's reading.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,You never want me to read to you.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W.:,Brain reads faster. I wish he could live here all the time.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,I'll be there as soon as I'm done!
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Buster:,Where's the Brain?

1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Buster:,Why don't you want him coming to the park with us?

1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mrs. Read:,Why can't you chew your food like Alan?
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Buster:,The Brain is nice. He wouldn't try to make you look bad on purpose.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,You're right. I guess it's not his fault my family likes him better.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,"I had to go to Buster's for something. Hi, Pal."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Brain:,Pal must've thought I was you.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mr. Read:,"Arthur, did you finish that homework?"
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,Sort of. No. I'll go do it.
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mrs. Read:,This game is fun!
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,D.W:,"When I played this game with Arthur it was boring. He didn't read all the rules like you, Alan."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Mrs. Read:,"Hm, that weekend went by quickly."
1,The Perfect Brother/Transcript,42,Arthur:,It sure did. See you!

1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Kate:,Booboo.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,But the silliest thing she ever saves is in the freezer: a snowball from last winter. It's in the freezer.

1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,But I wanna freeze it.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Mrs. Read:,Why?
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,Because this was the best day of my life and I always want to keep a piece of it. So can I?
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Mrs. Read:,Okay. But put it on a plate so it doesn't stick to the freezer.

1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,Grandma!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Grandma Thora:,"D.W.! My favorite grandchild! D.W. runs up to her and they hug. Oh, hi, Arthur."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,") He wipes his nose with his sleeve. Hi, Grandma."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Grandma Thora:,"D.W., you're so wonderful! And how's your snowball?"
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,Hold it! Hold it! That's not what really happened. Grandma never even knew about the snowball.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,"Well, maybe..."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,I'll tell you what happened.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Grandma Thora:,"Hello, children! Arthur! You certainly have grown!"

1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Mrs. Read:,I didn't notice. Hm.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,Wait a minute! That dog was in the kitchen!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,So you think Pal took your snowball?
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,It's possible.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,Then he just jumped down.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,Impossible. Dogs can't open umbrellas.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.:,Maybe he learned. What else does he have to do all day?
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Announcer ):,…went to Agassi. That’s thirty-love.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,Don’t forget Buster and I were here yesterday too.

1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Mrs. Read:,There's more ice-cream in the freezer.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,Oh. I'll get it!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,Huh? Mmm!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,"You're not writing, Buster."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,Because that never happened! We were all having ice cream...
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,"…and the other snake says “You can’t love me. I'm your other end!"""

1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,I can get my own ice cube.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,Darn it! There isn't any lousy ice in here. She takes out the snowball. Maybe this is big enough to cool it off.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,"Oh, that is so untrue!"
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,Wait! What were you guys doing while I played piano for grandma?

1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur+Buster+Francine:,)
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,We weren't there when Arthur did it!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,Grr! I didn't do it!!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,Somebody did it. I want a confession! Confess! Confess!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,"I've reached a conclusion by discerning the truth from the eyewitness accounts. It’s very simple. While we were busy, a space alien materialized."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster ):,"In a scientific search for samples of human food, he took the snowball and nothing else, because he left in a hurry."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Mr. Read:,) Huh?! The alien disappears. Now who left that freezer door open?
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,It's the only logical answer. That’s why the plate is missing also.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,That's crazy!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,One of you took my snowball!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,"Why don't you just confess, Buster?"
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,Yeah!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,Me? Why don't you?!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Francine:,It was probably Arthur.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,Me? How could you think I would do something like that?
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Mrs. Read:,Whoever did it should just admit it. It's not nice to do this to a little girl.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,I think you're all in on it. You're trying to break a child's heart. It's a conspiracy!
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Grandma Thora: ,"You know, someone's going to get their feelings hurt if everyone doesn't calm down."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Mr. Read:,"Hey, everybody, look outside!"
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,It's snowing.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Buster:,The first snow of the year.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,Big deal. It'll never be the same.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,"D.W., we'll have just as much fun as last year. Maybe more."
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,Promise?
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,Arthur:,Yeah. I do.
1,D.W.'s Snow Mystery/Transcript,43,D.W.: ,I just wish I knew what happened to my snowball.

1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,Wow.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,) That's even older than the cafeteria hot dogs.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Mr. Ratburn:,"Ahem! He shows the next slide. The Appian Way was the chief highway from Rome to Greece. It was built in 312 B.C. It's still in use today.

1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,"What do you mean? We write it, then read it to the class."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,"No, no. We want to be the best in the class, right? Then, we shouldn't read it to the class. I should read it to the class."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,Maybe there's a more interesting way to do it.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,Hm!
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,") I-I mean, more creative!"
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,"Guys, guys! What if we wrote a song? ) “Ancient Rome!” Plays two notes. “It’s not like home!” Plays two notes. “Colosseum!” Plays three notes."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,We could do it as an interpretive dance.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,With those feet?!
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Woman ):,(screams)
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,Let's make a video!
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,How are we gonna make it look ancient?
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,I have a really old coat!
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,"Think. We need to show what Rome was like. And be interesting, too."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,"Ooh, I’ve been waiting for this book to be in."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,“How to Write and Draw Comic Books.”

1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,"I'm done, guys! Here's my page."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,That isn't a comic page. That's just a drawing.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,"That's called a splash panel. It's full of action, look. That's Spartacus. He's defending all the pizza from the attacking soldiers who are hidden in the horse. They wanna take over the pyramids. That's Julius Caesar on a glider. There were no jet engines then. Hey, your pages aren't like mine!"
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Mr. Ratburn:,"Remember, your history projects are due tomorrow. The bell rings and the students run out. I have great expectations!"
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,Yours rots! You should make yours like mine. Mine is the first page!

1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Prunella:,But you didn't use any real history at all.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,Maybe not very much... None.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,I know you're just gonna say it's great. I just need to know how great.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Brain:,"Francine, the Olympics were in Greece, not Rome."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Umpire:,Strike one!
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,I'll just change it to Roman athletes at the Greek Olympics.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Brain:,It wouldn't have happened. The Romans banned the Olympics in 194 BC. The second ball flies past Francine. Didn't you do any research?

1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,I should have done some research.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,"Yeah, I guess a history project needs some history in it."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,"Well, Binky really liked my page, so I guess I have to start all over."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,We all have to start over! But there's no time. Ratburn's gonna fail us.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,"It's too bad, because you drew the Roman Forum very well!"
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,You think so?
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,Your colosseum and chariot race are cool.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,"So is this Julius Caesar, even though he's flying!"
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,I bet our project could have been great if we'd done it together.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,There is a lot of good stuff here. Maybe we don't have to start over!
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,"""In 44 BC, he was stabbed in the Roman Senate, and that was the end of Julius Caesar.”"

1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,We all did.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,But not right away! It took a while for us to figure it out.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Mr. Ratburn:,A good team effort. Although I'm not sure they had pizza delivered to the senate.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,"Next time, we'll decide what we'll do before we do it."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,What time are we meeting at the Sugar Bowl?
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Arthur:,I thought we were going to the park.

1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Mr. Ratburn:,"Quiet, please! The next team is about to report."
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Binky:,We’ve chosen to do our report on Egypt as an interpretive dance.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Binky:,Mummies were dead Egyptians who died and got embalmed and tightly wrapped in cloth after they died.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Buster:,We agreed to go to the Sugar Bowl.
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Binky:,Mm-mm-mmph!
1,Team Trouble/Transcript,44,Francine:,I don't care what you two do. I'll be at the movies.

1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Mr. Frensky:,"This place is like our nerve center. Our war room. Action, power - it all happens right here."

1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,Wow!
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Mr. Frensky:,"Afternoon, Alisha! How's she running?"
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Alisha:,Paper recycling's at 70% of capacity. Plant B flow is at five million gallons and hour. A lady on Elm Street has a big pile of stinky fish bones in her backyard. She says it's fertilizer.
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Mr. Frensky:,"Keep me posted! Before we tackle any major project, Matt here designs a computer simulation. I asked him to work something up for your World's End Park idea."
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Matt:,Would you like to give it a try?
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Matt:,"It all depends on how many kids join your Clean-Up Brigade. If only one kid joins, garbage will keep building up."
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Matt:,But see what happens if you get more kids to join.
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,Wow! Is that really how it'll work?
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Matt:,"Well, there are a few variables but, yeah, provided you get the equipment."
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Mr. Frensky:,"Which reminds me, Matt. Do we have any spare uniforms?"

1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Alfonz:,What's going on over there?
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Boy:,Don't get involved.
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,"You clean it up! I'm going home! Come on, Pal! He notices that Pal is eating the wrappers. Pal!"

1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,"Stop! They stop. You guys almost killed my dog with your trash. Enough's enough. The Tough Customers look embarrassed. Now, who's gonna help me clean up this park?"
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Molly:,What??
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,"It's impossible to clean this park by myself. Now who's gonna help? The Tough Customers look foolish. No hands? Well, then I'll give you your assignments. Molly, you start over there!"
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Molly:,But...
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Pal:,)
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Molly:,"All right, all right. Don't have kittens!"
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,Now you two! Let's see what we can do about those papers!
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,"Well. Yeah, I guess they are."
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,Me too. But it turns out she...
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Francine:,"Arthur! Dad! Sorry I'm late. I had to track down everyone. I was afraid you wouldn't have enough volunteers. Muffy, Buster and Sue Ellen ) come on foot. Arthur, I'm sorry I tried to get out of helping you. I guess I... What the...?!"
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Francine:,But... how did you...? How did they...?
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,These guys showed me how important it was to keep the park clean.
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Binky:,"Yeah, somebody could choke if they tried to eat this garbage!"
1,Arthur Cleans Up/Transcript,50,Arthur:,") Right, Binky. Pointy stick?"

1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Sue Ellen:,It smells here.
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Mr. Frensky:,"You're right. Fantastic, isn't it? Earth and compost and fuel and smoke! ) Ah... But that's not even the best thing about working in a dump. The absolute number one best thing of all is..."
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Mr. Frensky:,...you get to drive a bulldozer! He moves some trash. Any questions?
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Buster:,Is it true you're with the FBI?
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Arthur:,Buster!

1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Kids:,Wow!
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Mr. Frensky:,"All this is made from stuff I found at the dump. Just goes to show you what you can do with a little imagination and a lot of trash. Well, what are you waiting for?"
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Kids:,)
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Mr. Frensky:,"So, the secret is out. Think Catherine will ever forgive me?"
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Francine:,I think we shouldn't tell her.
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Mr. Frensky:,Maybe I should do like she says and get one of those jobs that comes with a tie and a briefcase.
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Sue Ellen:,) She runs back as Mr. Frensky picks up Arthur. Your dad's the best!
1,"My Dad, the Garbage Man/Transcript",51,Buster:,No kidding. Is he really with the FBI?

1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Powers:,Son! What are you doing?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Arthur:,Ow!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Powers:,"I told you, let the robot clean up! He pushes a button on a remote control and a robot starts cleaning up the room. Now you have more time for homework."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Arthur:,Great.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Arthur:,"Well, maybe that wouldn't be so great. But what if I lived with Binky's family?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Binky:,)
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Arthur:,"Get out of here, Binky! I gotta clean the room!"

1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Muffy, you already brought a TV!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,What if I want to watch two things at the same time?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Servant:,)
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,Over here.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Catherine:,"Excuse me, I know this is probably unimportant, but there was barely enough room for two people before you brought in this junk!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"I know. Catherine, how would you like your own room?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Catherine:,My own room?

1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"No, a little more to the left."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,)
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,That's perfect. Now let's go back to the statue.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Muffy!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,What?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"I'm not your servant, you know!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"I'm sorry, Francine. I just wanted your room to look perfect. Can you ever forgive me?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Sure. Sorry I yelled.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,Me too. Now just move the statue a little to the left.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Grrr!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mrs. Frensky:,Muffy! Francine! Dinner!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Thank goodness. With all this moving, I'm famished!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Whoa, now let me get this straight. You want me to eat food cooked last night, that other people touched, that got cold and then was cooked again?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mrs. Frensky:,"Sure, kiddo. It's called leftovers."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,I call it vomitrocious.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,There's something wrong with your TV. You only get three channels.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Yeah. We can get one more, but you have to put the antenna on your head and dance around. Want to give it a try?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"No VCR, no video games. I think we studied this period in school. Pretty soon we invent the wheel, right?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"Football, anybody?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,I’ve got a better idea. Let's go get ice-cream!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Friday nights are ice-cream nights, Muffy."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"Tell you what. Since Muffy's our guest, why don't we break with tradition and get some ice-cream right now?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,...and a scoop of ham ripple and sprinkle and nuts and whipped cream....
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Does this mean we get to have ice cream every Tuesday, daddy?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"We need to try to make Muffy feel at home, Francine. Just think how hard it must be for your sister to adjust to living at Muffy's."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Catherine:,)
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"Hurry up in there, ducks. Bedtime!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Mr. Frensky, I’ve been thinking. Why doesn't your family have as much money as my family does?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,That's a good question.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"All I know is there are some perfectly nice people who are rich and some equally nice people who aren't. Besides, what would I do with money? Could I buy a better family?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"No, but you can get more TV channels."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,") Well, I think I could live without that. I'd rather spend my time with Francine and her friends."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Sock attack!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"Ah, you got me!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"This is all very heartwarming, but you're hurting my feet."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"I'll leave my bike at home, so we can walk to school together."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,Walk?! All the way to school?! Are you joking?! The Crosswire limousine stops in front of her. I'll see you there!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,How did you get here so fast?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mrs. Frensky:,Francine! You forgot your lunch!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,You want my driver to take you back?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,What happened to the electricity?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Bailey:,And now the little girl jumps on the pony's back... and now the pony has begun to fly... and now there's a rainbow...
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Give it a rest, Bailey. It's just not the same."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Lady:,Rrr!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Lady:,)
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Lady ):,Hello? This is your neighbor from downstairs. What's going on?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Francine, I was listening to that!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Lady ):,"Would you turn that music down, please?!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"You can't play it that loud, Muffy! The neighbors."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Let me get this straight. I can't have the food I like, I can't watch the TV channels I want and now I can't play my music?!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Look, Muffy, If you don't like it, why don't you just go home?!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,") Well, maybe I will! I'm getting pretty tired of being poor, anyway!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Fine!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,Fine!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,I guess we were just too much for Muffy.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Don't call her that. If you have to talk about her, her name is Muff-rotten-stinkweed-Crosswire-spit."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"Wow, strangely enough rotten-stinkweed-spit is my own middle name. Do you think we could be related?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Daddy, please."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Hello?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"I just want to tell you I'm leaving, and if I die sneezing I hope you're happy."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"May I speak to her? Hello? Muffy? Look, if you leave, who's gonna play football with us?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Oh please!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,Tell Francine I heard that.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,I just wish you'd reconsider.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Oh, okay. I'll stay."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Whoa, whoa, whoa, aren't you gonna ask me if you can stay?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Excuse me, Mr. Frensky, someone wants to talk to me. Okay, Francine, am I allowed to stay?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,No!
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,)
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"You aren't! For the first time, Muffy looks genuinely shocked. You've been rude and selfish, Muffy Crosswire!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,W-what?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Maybe I shouldn't have been so mean to Muffy, but she didn't care about anybody but herself."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Mr. Frensky:,"Maybe it seemed that way, honey, but maybe Muffy's just not used to living in a house with different rules. It might be a good thing for you two to talk about it in school tomorrow."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,I hope she doesn't sneeze to death before then.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Muffy?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,Francine. I wanted to tell you I'm sorry I was so rude. I really did like staying at your house.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Aren't you going to take your limo?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,I decided to walk with you today.
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,Really? You sure you aren't gonna to faint or something?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"I'm having Bailey follow. The limousine follows the girls. I even started to miss leftovers. The hotel wouldn't make them for me. Francine, do you think...?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,What?
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Mumsie says the carpet's almost out, but... do you think I could stay one last night with you?"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,"Well, if you think you can survive with just three TV channels."
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Muffy:,"Of course. If I can survive walking all the way to school, I can survive anything!"
1,Poor Muffy/Transcript,52,Francine:,)

1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss Turner:,Shh!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,I don't get it. Who would want to get rid of our books?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Newsman ):,In local news. A parents' group chased a series of children's books off the shelves of the public library today. Julie?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Newswoman ):,"PAWS, P-A-W-S, that's Parents Against Weird Stories, say the scary stories are bad for kids. We tried to reach EA dePoe, the writer of the books, for comment - with no success. PAWS is having a rally for other concerned parents tomorrow in front of the library."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,"Condition red, Arthur. If we ever want our pants scared off again, we’ve got to do something fast."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,Arthur?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,What are we gonna do? It's not fair!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Brain:,"Not much we can do. Generally speaking, minors have limited access to legal recourse or arbitration."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"Come on, we can't give up. We never gave up before."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,Sure we have.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Brain:,Lots of times.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,Not when it's important. Remember when you helped clean out my garage so I could go see “Galaxy Avengers”?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,"Hey, look at me. Whoa!"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,Ah!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,"I remember. Nice going, Buster."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"The point is, we made it to the movie."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Brain:,The next day.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"Okay, but what about the time Buster needed help with math...?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,Hm...
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,Maybe Arthur's right. But what can we do?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,"I know! We can go on strike! No more homework till we get our books back! The others gape at him. Well, heh, it was worth a try."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Brain:,We must quantitatively demonstrate that we're not alone in our opinion.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,Huh?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,We have to show PAWS that a lot of kids want their books back.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Muffy:,)
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,I know - we should get signatures on a petition. That's what my mom did to save the old City Hall building.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Sue Ellen:,Do we have enough time? They meet tomorrow.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,There's only one way to find out.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,"Good Morning, Elwood City!! Step right up! Sign your name to save our books and see the Amazing Arthur perform feats of derring-do!"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"Buster, are you sure about this?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,"It's like a commercial, Arthur. Before we can get them to sign, we have to get their attention. Now go ahead!"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Audience:,)
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,Sure thing! After you sign on the dotted line!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,"PAWS is takin' your books away, so I'm asking for your help today. Line up now and sign your name. That's the point of my jump-rope game!"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Brain:,Impact on school performance is geometric. As you can see there's a marked rise in the learning curve. Is it not obvious you should sign?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Man:,No. But we'll sign if you promise to stop explaining why we should!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,People:,)
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"Excuse me, ma’am, but a parents' group took our favorite books from the library. Would you sign a petition to put them back?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,I see I'm not the only one doing volunteer work today! But it depends on the books. I wouldn't go against your parents.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,They're not our parents. We don't know who they are. But the books are our favorite books – the Scare-Your-Pants-Off-Club.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"The Scare-Your-Pants-Off-Club books? Do you read them, er...?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,Arthur. All of them! I haven't missed a single one!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"Then this is serious. Maybe I should speak to this parents group. Don't give up, Arthur. You and your friends are doing a good thing!"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"Sure. Thanks... I think. Hey, wait! You forgot to sign."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,Do you think we have enough names?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,I think so. We just have to hope they'll listen to us.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Muffy:,Who wants to go to Wonderworld for free? I'm having a big party there for all my friends! And you're all invited.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,Wow! Wonderworld!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Francine:,Lick?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Muffy:,My mom won't let me. Too much fat...sugar... oh... take it away.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,"Hey! Hey, Muffy! Look, it's your parents."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mrs. Crosswire:,You don't know the harm these books do! My poor daughter read just one and it gave her nightmares.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,We started PAWS to save other kids. We're having a big rally for all concerned parents at the library tomorrow.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Buster:,Your mom and dad started PAWS?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Muffy:,Yes. And they say that no one working against them is allowed to come to my party.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Kids:,What?!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"But we have to get our books back, Muffy."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Muffy:,"You just have to decide which means more to you, Arthur, my fabulous party – or a bunch of silly books."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"I don't know what to do, Mom. I don't want to miss Muffy's Wonderworld party, but I don't want to lose my favorite books, either."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, all I can say is when you add everything up, you have to do what you think is right. Even if it means making a sacrifice."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,But what if I'm the only one to protest PAWS? What if all my friends decide to go to Wonderworld instead?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Read:,"Can't be afraid to look foolish for something you believe in, son. Hand me that rubber nose. I'm late for the kids' charity benefit. He sits down on a loud whoopee cushion. Ah! Ha, I wondered where that was."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,"I'm not doing this for Ed Crosswire of Crosswire Motors, corner of Park and Lakewood - open most nights till ten - I'm doing it to save our kids."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"Uh, Mr. Crosswire, speaking for the kids, we really want our books back, and we got these signatures of support."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,"That's nice, sonny. But believe me, we’re doing this for your own good."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"Excuse me, but have you read any of the books? Well, you you?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,I am proud to say I wouldn't read those books if you paid me.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,It's Miss McWord - my grade school English teacher!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"You never did read, Ed. That's why the writer works hard to write stories kids like to read - so maybe they'll read other books too."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,"Er, what makes you such an expert?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,I wrote them.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,You wrote the Scare-Your-Pants-Off-Club books?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"Yes, “EA dePoe” is my pen-name."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Muffy:,) Miss dePoe! I'm your number one fan! I have all of your books. Does anyone have a pen? Oops!
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,You've read them all?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mrs. Crosswire:,"Well, Mary Alice Crosswire. If it wasn't that woman's books that gave you a nightmare, what was it?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,Just a minute here. I think I'm beginning to understand who ate my quart of Hasenpfeffer ice-cream.
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mrs. Crosswire:,"You know it gives you nightmares, Muffy. How could you!"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"Ed. What do you say, we actually read one of my books and see what you think."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,Oh. Yes. Why not?
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"""And since that night, nobody has dared to steal anything from the haunted hamburger stand again!"""
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Muffy:,"Well, Daddy?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,"Well, I guess I shouldn't have tried to stop you kids from reading books I hadn't read myself."
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Arthur:,"Then we can have them back, Mr. Crosswire?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Mr. Crosswire:,"Well, on one condition. Everybody looks worried. Would you read another one? Please?"
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Kids:,)
1,The Scare-Your-Pants-Off Club/Transcript,56,Miss McWord:,"""No one in the village knew why the old man lived all alone, deep in the dark woods. Only the animals of the forest knew his secret."""
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"When you join a team or club, there are rules you have to obey."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,What would happen if no one on the soccer team followed the rules?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,George:,Huh?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Mr. Ratburn:,What's the score?!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"To join the library, you have to agree to return your books on time, or it's not a library!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"And to be in the swimming club, you have to know how to swim..."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,"Who wants to waste time learning how to swim? Bombs away! He does a cannonball, then flounders in the water. Gaah! Aah! Help! Aah! Save me!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,...for obvious reasons.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,"Binky, stand up!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,Huh? He stands up and finds that the water only goes up to his belly. Phew!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"So, you see how important rules can be..."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Timmy:,"To pass this house, you have to pay a dollar and hop on one foot!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,...sometimes.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Mr. Ratburn:,Mr. Haney has an announcement he'd like to make about the Elwood City Strawberry Festival parade.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Mr. Haney:,Don't forget. Only three weeks left to complete your costumes and floats.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Mr. Ratburn:,I'll be wearing a giant strawberry shortcake made of real strawberries.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Mr. Haney:,"And I'll be the king of the Button Island float, on top of this thirty foot fake tree."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,We have to start working on our parade float.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,I know! I told everyone to meet in the treehouse.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Here are our possible floats. Buster's Festival of Food idea...
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,"We all ride a giant revolving pizza dressed as the major food groups: mushrooms, pepperoni and anchovies!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,That's mine. We all ride the twisted nucleotide chains of the DNA double helix!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,Okay. Here's my back-up idea. We all just wear our baseball uniforms.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,That's a good one.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,I like that.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,"Oh, no!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,Don't you like it?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Not that. That!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,It's Arthur's dwonky little sister again! )
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,Ugh! She follows him everywhere!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,But what if this was the Parade Flat Club? And only members could come in?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,We can try it. ). But she probably won't fall for it.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,D.W.:,"Hi, guys! What're you doing?"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,This is a meeting of the Parade Float Club. Members only.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,D.W.:,I wanna be in the parade too! How do I join?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"Uh... Francine hands him a note. ""All members must be able to kick a ball out of the yard."""
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,") Okay, go ahead."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,D.W.:,I'll break my foot if I kick that!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Then you can't be in the club.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,D.W.:,"You kick it! Everyone who is in the club has to kick it, right?"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,“The kicking rule is hereby cancelled. You must draw a funny picture of Mr. Ratburn to join.”
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Kids:,)
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,D.W.:,All done!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Sorry. It has to be funny.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,) Sorry. I think it's funny.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Oh.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,D.W.:,So I'm in the club?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"To join, you have to be in the third grade."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,"If you're so smart, why didn't you figure that out before?"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,Yeah!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,"That's that. You know, we can use some real rules for this club!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Yeah. Like Buster can't eat all the snacks all the time!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,)
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,And we need to collect some dues to fix up this place.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Sue Ellen:,Dues...? Like money?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Fix up? What's wrong with it? I like it like this!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,Eugh! Filth!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,We need new linoleum. A dollar a week should do it.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,A dollar a week... each??
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,I don't see why not.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,I wouldn't give you two cents if you paid me!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,"If you don't wanna pay, you don't have to be in the club!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,"But, Muffy, I only get fifty cents a week allowance."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,"I'll pay for you, Francine. But nobody else!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,We can't charge a dollar a week! This tree house has always been free!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,"Fine! We don't need this old shack. We'll have our own clubhouse, with computer games and everything!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,It's only for people who can afford it!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,I'm not paying a dollar a week to use this crummy old place!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"If you think it's so crummy, you can go too!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,You want me to go? Okay! They'll have computer games!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Wow! That's the clubhouse?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,I now declare the Muffy Club headquarters officially open!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,The Muffy Club?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,"It's her house, Buster. Like or leave it."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,Voilà!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Wow!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,All right!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,) Mm.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,"Dues are a dollar for us... and two dollars for you, Buster!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Why is it more for me?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Because you eat like a pig.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,"Well, it's not fair!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,You don't have to belong.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Then I won't!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,"Who needs him, anyway? She gets out food. Macaroon, Francine?"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,What do you want?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Muffy's club is rotten.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"Well, the Parade Float Club has some new rules! Sue Ellen..."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Sue Ellen:,"“Rule Number One. Anyone can join except Buster Baxter, who is a dirty traitor for joining Muffy's stinky club!”"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Those are the rules. They're on paper. We've got to follow them. Sorry!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Who wants to join their stupid old club anyway? I'll just start my own club! He drapes the bedsheet over a table and climbs under it. I now declare the Reading Comic Books Under the Blanket Club open!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Francine! I'm open! Pass it!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Ha! Huh?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Rattles:,)
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Why didn't you kick it to me?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Our club charter says we can't pass to any member of your club.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,But we could have won the game!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Sorry. Club rules.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Sue Ellen:,Where are you going?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,I'm sorry. We can only eat with club members.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Members of my club can sit with anybody they want.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Sue Ellen:,What's your club?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Come on. I'll tell you.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Don't go with him! Sue Ellen!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Sue Ellen:,"If I can't be in your club and also talk to Buster, then I quit!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Grr!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,This is no fun. Do we have to read comics every day?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Yes! It's part of the club!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,I'm going to form a club where members always have fun.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,Yeah!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Aah! Binky! Where are you going?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,I want to have fun too!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,"Salt and pepper, peas and carrots."
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,Go away!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Why?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,"You didn't show up yesterday! The rules are, members must show up every day!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,I was sick!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,Rules are rules! You're out! Get off my property or I'm calling the police!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Sue Ellen:,There's no air under here! All that old food stinks! Why can't we meet outside?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Because it's the Reading Comics Under the Blanket Club!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Sue Ellen:,Then I quit!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,Mm... Fine! Who needs you?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,"Ah! Paramecium! You're not having fun, are you?"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Binky:,No.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Brain:,Then you can't be in my club! You have to have fun to be in this club! It's the fun club!!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Francine! He catches up with her. Wanna go to the Sugar Bowl?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,Sorry. I have an Exciting Club meeting.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,Oh. Well... so do I.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"Sue Ellen, wanna go to the..."

1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,This meeting of the Exciting Club is now in session!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Buster:,) Phew! Sue Ellen's right. There is no air under there!

1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,"Hey, Francine! Come on up!"
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,So what's the name of this club?
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,D.W.:,"I was here first, so it's my club, and my club only has one rule. She unveils a drawing of a sedan chair. We ride my float in the parade."

1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Mr. Ratburn:,Get back! Back! Oh! Go away! Get away! Stop that!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Mr. Read:,Here they come!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,I never knew D.W. was so smart!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Muffy:,Me neither. She had a better idea than Arthur!
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Francine:,I don't know why Arthur didn't let her join the Parade Float Club in the first place.
1,My Club Rules/Transcript,57,Arthur:,)
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,What is that?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Buster:,"""New""? In what century?"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Haney:,Let me get this straight. You were hurrying home on your bike to do your chores...
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Garbagewoman:,)
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Garbageman:,)
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Arthur:,Did you think there was something fishy about Francine's story?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Buster:,Yeah! Does she expect us to believe she was hurrying home to do her chores? How dumb does she think we are?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,"I think Arthur meant the bike-eating truck was fishy, Buster!"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Brain:,Francine mustn’t want us to find out who really took her bike.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,Why?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Buster:,"Of course! Because whoever it is, is somebody we all know!"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Buster:,And now the question is... which one of us knows how to drive a bike-eating truck?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,Go away!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Catherine:,"So after you chased these robbers, then what?"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,Then I was lost. And I wandered around with amnesia until I hit my head on a rock and all my memory came back.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Catherine:,That's from the movie we saw last week. You'll have to do better than that if you want a new bike.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,"I say, Binky's behind it and it's up to us to make him confess!"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Brain:,How?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,We threaten him! Any volunteers?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,You are the biggest bunch of babies!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Arthur:,Muffy!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,"Don't interrupt! One of my best and truest friends has been traumatized, and if it takes a Crosswire to right this terrible wrong, then so be it."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Kids:,)
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,It won't be the first time and it won't be... Binky faces her. ...the last. What do you want?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Binky:,Are you telling everyone I stole Francine's bike?!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,What if I am?!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Binky:,"Yeah, well... He suddenly looks scared. I didn't do it."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,Then who did?!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,I did.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Kids:,)
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,I did.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,Francine?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,"I know, I know. I didn't really steal it. I just sort of threw it away. So leave Binky alone."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Kids:,)
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Muffy:,Great. Now everyone hates me thanks to you.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,You found it!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,"Yeah, it was right here. I guess the thieves got scared and dumped it in the trash."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,Dad... it wasn't thieves. It was me.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,"I know. Why'd you do it, Francine?"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,"Because everyone was making fun of me, and I thought if it got stolen maybe you'd buy me a new one."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,I can understand how you felt. But it's no excuse for lying about it.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,"I know, Dad. I guess I didn't want to hurt your feelings. I knew how much the bike meant to you. I'm really sorry."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,Did you really ride that bike to school every day?
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,Uphill both ways.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,"Wow! Hey! Maybe we could fix it up! How about it, Dad? All it really needs is some paint."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,"I say, what are we waiting for?"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Catherine:,This better be good!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,Ladies and... ladies! We'd like to present Francine's new and completely restored... bicycle!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Catherine:,Hmph.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,"And now, the moment of truth! The test drive! Francine..."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,"You first, Dad."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,You sure? I wouldn't want to deprive you of the moment you've been waiting for.
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Francine:,I'm sure!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mrs. Frensky:,"Be careful, honey..."
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Catherine:,"Dad, you're not...! Don't let anyone see you!"
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,Don't worry! Just a little spin around the block! Just to make sure it's absolutely safe!
1,Stolen Bike/Transcript,58,Mr. Frensky:,Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo! Vroo-ooo-oom!

2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Oh, that's because I'm, er, thinking of changing my name. That's right, and I'm, I'm sending out these postcards, er, to try out new names. Fred is just one. Do you like it? He drops the cards in the mailbox. How about Jasper? He walks quickly backwards. That's another one. Julius?"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Prunella:,Uh...
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,) What am I doing? He goes into the living room where Mr. Rogers is playing the tune on the piano. D.W. sits beside him.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,Yay!
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Wow, that was great!"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,"Arthur plays the piano, too. Show Mr. Rogers, Arthur."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Uh, well..."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,Maybe Arthur doesn't feel like doing it right now.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Yeah, maybe later."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,"Maybe you could take me on that walk around your neighborhood now, D.W."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,) He hurriedly sits down at the piano. Wait! I feel like playing! I feel like playing the piano!
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,"Very good, Arthur."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Um, let me see. Did I play “The Happy Boat”?"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,Four times.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,"You could be a fine musician someday, Arthur."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,"Come on, Mr. Rogers. I'll show you around my neighborhood."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Wait, I didn't play you my scales."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,"Arthur, Mr. Rogers is going to die of boredom."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,I promised D.W. I'd let her take me around before it got too late. Maybe you'd like to come for a walk with us.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Binky+Punella:,)
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,You can't go!
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,What??
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"I mean, what if, er... What if somebody recognizes you from the TV? They'll want autographs and... A disguise! That's it! I'll go get you a disguise!"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,I don't think I need a disguise. But I get the idea you're not feeling good about something.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Me? ) Wait, I’ve a better idea!"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,That certainly is a very impressive statue. He looks like he's about to say something very important.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,") Arthur, this beard itches. Why do I have to wear it?"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,It's so nobody will see... He fiddles with his glasses. ...so Mr. Rogers can... so...
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,You're touching your glasses again.

2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Binky:,)
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"This way, Mr. Rogers!"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,Garbage?! You wanted to show Mr. Rogers people's garbage?!
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"No, uh..."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Buster:,Mr. Rogers?? Is that really you?
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,It certainly is. What's your name?
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Buster:,I forget.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"Oh, brother."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,)
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Buster:,How do you know Dopey and Sneezy?
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,"Look, Mr. Rogers, the joke shop! And over there is where Grandma Thora parks her car when she goes to Bingo."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Arthur:,"I know you can't keep a secret, but you can't tell anybody about Mr. Rogers staying at our house."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Brain:,Arthur looks quite distinguished with facial hair.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Prunella:,He's been acting weird like that all day. He wanted me to call him Fred.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Brain:,"Plainly, Arthur's suffering from a form of psychological stress brought on by too much homework. The same thing even happens to me sometimes."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Rubella:,"No. No, that's not it."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Prunella:,"What is it, Rubella? Do you see something?"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Rubella:,It's just as I feared: Zombies! Zombies are here in Elwood City!
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Brain:,"Oh no, I don't think..."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Rubella:,Hush!
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Prunella:,"Hush, Brain!"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Rubella:,"Your friend Arthur is under a hypnotic spell. It's up to us to break the trance, before he turns us all into... zombie slaves."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,"It all looks so good, David. Would you like a roll, Buster?"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Buster:,"Mr. Rogers, does King Friday ever get in the trolley and come out to see you?"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,D.W.:,"Oh, brother."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,"King Friday usually stays in Make-Believe, Buster. Except when he flies in the purple jet."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Buster:,"And then there was this one time on your show, you learned to dance. And I learned it, too."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,"Wow, you remembered that really well, Buster."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers:,"You know, Arthur. I wonder if we could talk a little. Sometimes, if I'm feeling embarrassed about something..."
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Mr. Rogers: ,") “In the long, long trip of growing / there are stops along the way / for thoughts of all the soft things / and a look at yesterday.”"
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Buster:,Aw! He was just getting to the good part!
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Buster:,Sounds like they're right outside.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Reporter:,It was a strange day in the neighborhood when Mr. Rogers came for a visit. Mr. Rogers comes out of the house and waves. Neighbors and journalists are gathered. The suspicious goings-on turned out to be nothing more than a visit from an old friend of the family.
2,Arthur Meets Mister Rogers/Transcript,1,Class:,)
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Students: ,Agh!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,: ,"Ah! Oh, thank you. Attention, students. ) Exciting...news."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur:,The teachers' carnival should be fun.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,"As long as Ratburn doesn't do another puppet show. ) If you don't laugh, I'll give you extra homework."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,: ,I disagree. ) I like Mr Ratburn's shows.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,") Anyone who's smarter than a rock knows those puppet shows are boring kids' stuff. (Fern looks a bit unhappy and leaves, Francine puts the sandwich down and eats Fern's cookie.) Guess she didn't want her dessert. (Arthur and Buster look at each other and appear concerned)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,Are you going to apologise to Fern?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,Apologise for what?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,You hurt her feelings.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine:,She'll get over it.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,Aren't you worried she might get mad?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,"Fern? That mouse? What's she gonna do? Be quiet at me?! ) Ooh, so scared! (mean chuckle)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,"Hey, get out of my way, Buster! ) What are you laughing at? (they all look shocked except for Arthur who is holding a piece of paper and laughing, but then he looks up and hurriedly hides it behind his back) What's that?"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,) It's my cartoon.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,) Out of my way! I'm better than everyone! I'm even better than people who are better than me! (Arthur laughs but looks awkward when she growls in anger) Is this cow supposed to be me?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,How could it be? Frank is a boy.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Muffy: ,"Admit it, Fern. It is too Francine. Look, ) Frank is pushy and loud and rude and insulting."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,"Stop helping me, Muffy!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,The Brain: ,"Fern, cows are females and bulls are males. A cow wouldn't be named Frank, it would be named Fran--)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,That's about as funny as biting an apple and finding half a worm! )
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs Tingley: ,") Good morning! Before classes begin, Mr Haney wants you to know what will you'll be doing for the carnival."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr Ratburn: ,) A new puppet show.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs Tingley:,Eek!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr Ratburn:,The Many-Headed Hydra vs Sinbad the Sailor. ) Whoa!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms Sweetwater: ,I'm going to conduct a happy singalong with a prize for the happiest singer-along-er! ) You don't look very happy! I think I need to sing someone a song right now!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs Tingley: ,) I think not!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms Sweetwater: ,"Oh, come on, let's sing!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs Tingley: ,No!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms Sweetwater: ,") I like fudge, I like fudge, if you ask me what I like, I'd say, ""I like fudge""."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs Tingley: ,) What will you be doing for the carnival?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,My famous fortune-teller act! ) You will be taking a trip!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms Sweetwater: ,"): I like fudge. I like fudge. If you ask me what I like, I say, ""I like fudge."" (Ms Sweetwater leaves quickly)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,I didn't mean right now!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms Sweetwater: ,") Come on, Miss Tingley! A little song is just what you need! (Mrs MacGrady looks confused)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr Haney: ,Miss Tingley!  )
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs Tingley: ,Eek!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr Haney: ,You're just in time to rehearse my grand finale when I saw you in half!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs Tingley: ,Me?!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr Haney: ,"Oh, don't worry, it's foolproof! Here, let me demonstrate with this board! ) It only looks like I'm cutting it, but in reality (the board breaks, surprising Mr Haney, Mrs Tingley leaves) Oops. Miss Tingley, wait!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster: ,") Your comic was so good, I drew one too. Mine's called The Big Clumsy Moose with Big Feet Named Frannie. (it depicts a badly-drawn big-footed moose with a red dress on)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,Her feet are named Frannie?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,The Brain:,) That's funny. I'm gonna do one too!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Binky: ,Me too!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Sue Ellen: ,I can do a better one than you guys!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,The Brain: ,"Oh, yeah?! )"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms. Sweetwater: ,Ready to sing?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms. Tingley: ,Eek!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms. Sweetwater: ,) “Why not smile? Why not smile? Do you think you’re gonna break your face? Why not smile?”     (She follows Miss Tingley down the corridor. Behind her comes Mr. Haney with his magic set.)
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr. Haney: ,"Come back, Miss Tingley!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Sue Ellen: ,"Look, Arthur, Frannie Foghorn!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,I think maybe this is bothering Francine.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,) She'll get over it.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,") Francine, uh..."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,") Oh, go eat an ant sandwich, Arthur! Cartoons and stones can't break my bones!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster: ,") Wait, you haven't seen mine!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,") Hey, give it to me! I want to read that! (reading) The Giant Slime That Came to School! (we see the comic animated)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Comic Teacher: ,") Three billion, six hundred and thirty million two hundred and seventy-nine thousand one hundred and forty-eight divided by seven thousand six hundred and eighty-one! Quickly! Quickly!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,") All the kids were at school, learning complicated math! And then it happened!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Giant Slime: ,) I'm here!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,") A giant slime (the comic students, who look like Arthur, Muffy and Buster, scream) came to school!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Comic Teacher: ,"Do the math or begone, large slime!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Giant Slime: ,Oh yeah?! )
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,") The big slime (slurping noise) our teacher! (the teacher screams, but the students cheer) But it wasn't all good. The slime made everyone do its rotten bidding, like play only games it was good at! (the slime pushes around the students and spits a ball through the basketball hoop)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Giant Slime: ,P-tooey! I win again!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Comic Students: ,This rots!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,) Bionic Bunny told it to leave...
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Bionic Bunny: ,"Slime, go away!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,"and it ) him too! (the slime eats Bionic Bunny, but he and the teacher are alive inside it)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Bionic Bunny: ,Know how to play Go Fish?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,) The slime was unstoppable! Until...
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster-like Cartoon Boy: ,"Boy, I'm hungry!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,"It was dark, so the boy didn't realize he was eating slime! )"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Cartoon Boy: ,"Mm, lime! ) Mmm!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Giant Slime: ,Cut that out! )
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,) The boy who would eat anything chased the slime!

2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,And he ) the whole thing!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Bionic Bunny: ,Thank goodness you eat like a pig!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Cartoon Boy: ,) You're welcome! (burps and knocks over Bionic Bunny and the teacher)
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster: ,"And I would eat a giant slime, if it was lime slime."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr Haney: ,") The teacher charity carnival is about to begin! (most of the students dash out, dropping the comics on the floor)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,"Boy, Francine, you left your comics everywhere!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster: ,"Finally, great art you can eat!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,Fern! I was reading these comics. That Francine sounds just terrible.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,She's the worst!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,"If you can get all the kids together who drew these, I have a way we can make her look really silly!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,"Sure, I'll be back in a sec."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,"It's all part of the fun! When you pull the rope, that pot of green gloop I made will pour on her. Here she comes. Be very quiet and wait 'til I say, ""green gloop"". ) That's your cue to pull the rope and dump the gloop on her."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster: ,") This is gonna be great. (Fern shh's him, Francine enters)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,"Ah, someone who wants their fortune told! Sit down, please and concentrate. ) I see a cow and a foghorn."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,) That's me. (her classmates giggle) What's that sound? (they go quiet)
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,Nothing. The spirits are restless. And I see a bully bulldozer.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,) I never saw that one but it's probably me too.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,That's you and a stinky sneaker? That's funny? Yes?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,I guess.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,But I see that you are not laughing.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,") Oh, Mrs MacGrady! I wish they'd stop making fun of me! I know I shouldn't have called Fern a mouse, but why did they all have to be so mean to me?!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,Did you hear that?
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Binky: ,I can't believe it. Francine has feelings.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,Yeah!
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,"Tissues to your left, dear. I see one more thing. Oh, yes, here's a cartoon of you as green gloop. ) I said there's a cartoon of you as green gloop! Green gloop! (the students just look guilty)"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,) I just wish they'd stop.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,"I think you came to the right fortune teller, dear."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Francine: ,") Thank you, Mrs MacGrady."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,Goodbye.
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster: ,"It was so fun making fun of her, we didn't think about how it made her feel."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,"I always say, ""Never serve anyone a stew that you wouldn't want to eat yourself."""
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,"Wait up, Francine!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Buster: ,Wait up! )
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Arthur: ,"Oh, by the way, maybe you'd better think about it before you dump that gloop on somebody. It might hurt their feelings."
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mrs MacGrady: ,Maybe you're right. I guess learned something today. Better catch your friends. )
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Fern: ,"Wow, way to go, Francine!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Ms Sweetwater: ,") Come back, we're about to begin!"
2,Draw!/Transcript,2,Mr Haney: ,") For the hundredth time, Miss Tingley, you have nothing to worry about!"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,Art class is fun. But the best part of any class is a field trip.

2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Ms. Bryan:,"You'll all break into teams and chooses a work of art to report on. Arthur and Buster, you'll be on a team... They high-five. ...with Binky Barnes."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,Binky?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,We're doomed. You know what'll happen.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,Isn't that report done yet?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,"We're working on it, Binky."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,"Work harder! I want an A-plus or better, understand?"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,Maybe working with Binky won't be so bad.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,"Yeah, maybe he won't care. Maybe he'll just do it the way we want."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,"I have lots of ideas for this report, pals. Lots of ideas!"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,Wow! Huh?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Ms. Bryan:,Come along!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,Wish I had a shark.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Francine:,Let's do our report about that one.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Muffy:,Cool!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Brain:,Affirmative.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,See anything you like?

2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,Don't you wanna look for something interesting?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,This is interesting! Think of the report we can do!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,I give up.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,What?? Don't you see? It's hanging sideways.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,What makes you think that?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,Look! It makes no sense this way.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,They don't hang paintings in a museum sideways. They're experts.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,"It's not sideways, Binky. Look, it's the same in this book."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,"That's wrong, too!"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,What did we do to get stuck with Binky?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,"If we do the report he wants, everyone will laugh at us."

2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Francine:,Sideways?? That's not sideways!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Brain:,"Oh, oh yeah, it's sideways - and I guess we should wear shoes on our hands, too!"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Ms. Bryan:,") Arthur, Buster, Binky...you fail!"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Class+Ms. Bryan:,)
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,We shouldn't have to report on his dopey painting. There's two of us and one of him. We outvote him.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,Yeah! But h-how do we tell him?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,I'll be Binky and you be us. We'll practice just like it'll happen.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,"Um... We don't wanna do that report, Binky. He puts on Arthur’s glasses. Right. Neither of us."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,"Well, we're gonna do it my way! Understand?!"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,"Okay. He takes off the glasses. Yeah, okay. Anything you say, Binky."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,Why are you giving up so easily?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,"Well, you said: do it exactly like it'll happen."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Francine:,Just tell Binky how you feel. What are you afraid of? He's just really big and very strong and kind of... mean. She realizes the problem. Maybe you should make like a cowskin and hide.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,Huh?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,How mad do you think Binky will be when we tell him we won't do his report?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur+Buster:,Aaaargh!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,I didn't think he could throw us this far.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,Satellite!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur+Buster:,Ahh!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,"First, he can never throw you hard enough to reach escape velocity."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,That's a load of my mind.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Brain:,Why don't you just compromise with him?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,Compromise? Yeah!
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,"What's ""compromise"" mean?"
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,"That's where you get to do some of what you want, and we get to do some of what we want."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,"You do the report you want, but we'll do something else."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,Then we put them together?
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,Yeah.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,That's right.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur+Buster:,We do them together.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,Okay.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Buster:,Phew.
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Binky:,"Wow, look at this! I found a painting that's completely upside down in this book."
2,"Binky Barnes, Art Expert/Transcript",3,Arthur:,Um... you got the book upside down.

2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,"It's simple. Just go to sleep in your pants, Arthur. That way, you don't have to worry about forgetting to put them on."
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,D.W.:,"Arthur, have you seen Nadine's teddy bear? It's pink, about this big... Hey! Why are you wearing your pants to bed?"
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,Er... because they're really stiff... and I'm trying to break them in.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,D.W.:,"Really? Cool! Mom was going to wash my pants to make them softer, but I'll just wear them to bed instead."

2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,"But it's bound to happen sooner or later, because I keep dreaming about it."
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,Not after today. I know how to cure you.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,I'll just hypnotize you. You are getting very sleepy. Ve-ery sleepy. You are not afraid of losing your pants.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,"Arthur, wake up. You were asleep. Did you have the dream?"
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,"No, I don't think so."
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,"Ha! Then it worked, just like TV."
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,"Wow, you cured me, Buster! I'm cured! Whoopee! His pants slip off. Hey, how did I do that?"
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,Maybe your mom's been using too much starch.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,) Help!
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,Yup! Those pants sure need a lot of fabric softener.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,Get them away! They're trying to eat me!

2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,This can't be happening! I must be dreaming!
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,"Buster! Buster! Wake me up, I'm having a nightmare!"
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,You don't look like you're asleep. Why do you think that?
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,Because everyone seems to know about my underwear dream.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,Not everyone. I just told a few kids.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,You did?? How could you?! You promised!
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,Because nothing I did was helping you. I needed some advice.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,This is so embarrassing! Everyone is laughing at me. That's what I was afraid of in the... Ow! He rips his pants on the lunch counter. )

2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Mrs. MacGrady:,"Well, here they are, good as new. Even better. Your back pocket was missing a button."
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,"Thanks, Mrs. MacGrady."
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,"Uh, is there a back exit I could use?"
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Mrs. MacGrady:,"No. But there's an old Zen saying, Arthur. “A banana without its peel is still a banana.”"
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,Uh-huh. What does that mean?
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Binky:,It means people get embarrassed all the time. Grown-ups too.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Mrs. MacGrady:,"You're still Arthur - a smart, kind young man. With or without your pants."
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Arthur:,It's been exactly one week since I had an underwear nightmare.
2,Arthur's Underwear (episode)/Transcript,9,Buster:,"That's great, Arthur. I never would have guessed that ripping your pants would be the thing to cure you."

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Arthur:,I think it's pretty easy to figure out the kind of special dream Buster would have.

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,"Thanks, Dad! Giddy-up!"
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Muffy:,"I don't care what anybody says.  My bike is the most powerful! I mean, how many speeds does your bike have, Brain? Mine has fifteen."
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Brain:,I'm afraid I must disagree. Mine with its half-horsepower assist is far superior.

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,"For riding lessons! You said if I could save the money, you'd take me!    The parents exchange embarrassed looks.    Right?"
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,"I told you, I'm never eating again!"
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Mrs. Frensky:,"Honey, it's not that we won't keep our promise. If we said you could learn to ride, then we want you to be able to do it."
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Mr. Frensky:,But the lessons are during the day when we're both at work. And you're too young to go by yourself.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Catherine:,"Hi, guys!"

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,Would you relax! It's only a boy!
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,"Now, the first thing is to meet the horses. Get to know them a bit. This guy's name is Bronco."
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,Can we pet him?
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,"Sure. Just remember, horses spook easily. So you want to be very gentle."
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Catherine:,It's just like velvet. Or a really nice cotton/poly blend.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,That's it. Nice and easy.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,Let me try!    She rushes to the horse which rears up.     Aah! Whoa! Is he like a wild stallion or something?!
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,"Actually, he's usually pretty gentle. He's all yours."
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,All set? Left hand on the reins... left foot in the stirrup...and up.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,Oof!
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,Don't feel bad. This will be a lot easier in a few years when you're taller.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,"Wow! This is really, really...   The horse starts moving.    ...high. Hey! Whoa! How do you make him stop?"
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,"Come on, Bronco. How do you make him go?"
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,You have to show him who's boss.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Catherine:,"That's right, Francine. Show him who's boss!"

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,Are you kidding?! I was born to ride!

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Stanley:,"Well, Francine's doing fine for a beginner, but she's not quite at your level  and we usually only offer this to our best students."

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,I don't know. What do you wanna do?

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Buster:,Socks? That sounds like fun.

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,"Remember, I don't feel like riding. I'm just going to watch."

2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,So?
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Catherine:,So maybe you could help me out and then I could give you a riding lesson.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,You?! Teach me?! Okay. Deal.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,This is my all-time favorite picture. You can have it.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Catherine:,"Thanks. I've got fifteen dollars. If we add in your thirty dollars and if I can baby-sit every night for the next... three years, we could buy a horse of our own!"
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,I guess we could keep him in the basement. He could live in the storage bin. It's sort of like a stall.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Catherine:,We could call him Stanley.
2,"Francine Frensky, Olympic Rider/Transcript",10,Francine:,I'm not calling my horse Stanley!

2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"Aha. These cookies contained an insidious East Bora Borean peanut that turned the eater into a mindless zombie. Another case solved by the brilliant Fern Watson! Holmes, it's time to feed the hound of the Baskervilles. Where is the can opener?"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,"Honey, what have you wanted to have more than anything in the world?"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,A detective kit!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,Don't be silly. The one thing you've always wanted to have is a slumber party.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,Oh.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,Hosting a party is just what you need to develop your social skills. Now put away all that silly detective stuff and let's start planning the perfect party.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,Okay. I'll do the invitations.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,"They're done! Well, the design is very nice, Fern, but where's the information?"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"That IS the information. It's from ""The Adventure Of The Dancing Men"". I've put the date, time and place in a secret code."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,What if the girls can't decode it?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"Then, they won't come. And they'll be happy because they don't want to come anyway. I'm boring. They know my party will be boring."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,Fern. Nobody thinks you're boring.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,My mom's making me go to Fern's party and it's gonna be boring.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,I might as well just wear my sleeping bag. I'll be falling asleep so fast!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Arthur:,But I bet Fern's mother makes cookies and cakes and bite-sized pizzas and hamburgers...
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,One cannot spend an entire party eating.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Sue Ellen: ,"Speak for yourself, Muffy."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"We'll just have to make our own party, that's all. Bring our games and toys. Fern won't mind. In fact, she'll be relieved. We're saving her from being dull."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Sue Ellen: ,I can bring my portable trampoline.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,I'm bringing my new Decathlon Debbie. She comes with her own discus.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,See? This party will be just great.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"You know, Mom, you don't need to stick around when everyone gets here. I can handle everything."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,"But I... Fern gives her a look. You take charge, hostess. You won't see me until dinner."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,I need help with my luggage.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Sue Ellen: ,"What on Earth did you bring, Muffy?"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,I have to be ready for all possible weather conditions.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,Indoors?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Girls: ,Wow!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,I have some ideas for games.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"Fern, we brought some games with us. That way you won't have to worry whether you're entertaining us. Aren't you relieved?"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"Oh, well..."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,Good!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"I win again! My bracelet is not only ancient, it's lucky!"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Jenna:,Can we please play something else?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"Well, I thought..."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,Paddle-ball contest!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Girls: ,)
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Sue Ellen: ,"We're not playing something else you'll win, Francine."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"I may not win, Sue Ellen. Nothing in life is certain."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,Time to bring out Decathlon Debbie.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Jenna: ,"I brought Amazonia, warrior princess. She can wrestle Decathlon Debbie."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,Decathlon Debbie doesn't wrestle! Ugh.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Prunella: ,I brought a label maker. What needs identifying?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"Well, let's decide on something."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,Jenna and Muffy should be doing this with us. It's fun.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Sue Ellen:,I guess they want to do what they want to do.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,"Hey! You ruined her hair! If she loses the gold medal over this, you're in big trouble."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,) This is stupid. I can play by myself at home.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,Dinner will be ready soon. What's wrong?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,Nothing.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters: ,What are the girls doing?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,Being bored.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,Ah! My bracelet! It's gone!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,Now calm down. There's a simple solution to this. Where do you last remember putting it down?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"If I knew that, the bracelet wouldn't be lost, wouldn't it, Muffy?"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Prunella: ,Organize a search party. Did anyone bring walkie-talkies?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,"Boredom, then loss of valuables. What a disaster!"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,My beautiful bracelet. What if it's gone forever?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,I think I know where it is.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,What?! Where is it?!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"I could tell when the party began, strange forces were afoot. In her fantasy she has flashbacks of the party with everyone dressed like people in classical detective stories. In real life the girls are sitting on the couch and hanging on Fern's lips. When Francine arrived, I could see the distinctive piece on her wrist. Other guests arrived, hidden motives safely tucked away. As the clock struck four, the bracelet had not left its owner's arm. But then..."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,That's right. I took it off and I put it... The shelf is empty. Now it's gone! Okay. Who took it?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Girls: ,Not me! I didn't take it!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,Please! All in good time.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"Muffy, you took it!"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,I did not!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"Francine, we can't keep going back and forth because you keep accusing people. It takes too long."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,Sorry.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,It was Jenna's turn to play a part in the goings-on.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Sue Ellen: ,"Jenna, wanna watch a video?"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,"Jenna, you ate my bracelet?!"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Girls: ,Francine!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Prunella: ,"Jenna, Mrs. Walters will be mad if you make a mess in her house. Stupid fringe."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Jenna: ,I don't remember a thunderstorm.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,Ssh! It's atmospheric. But as dinner hour approached...
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,My bracelet!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"So we return to the scene of the events. The question is, who took the bracelet and where is it now? It is time to reveal all."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Francine: ,My bracelet!
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Muffy: ,So how did it end up there?
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"The key was Prunella's neatness. When I saw the table was bare, I realised someone had cleaned it. And I knew who that someone was."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Prunella: ,"Oh, Jenna!"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Sue Ellen: ,"Fern, you are SO observant!"
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Jenna: ,You're a regular Encyclopedia Brown.
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,"He's a bit of an amateur, actually. The truly great detective is..."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Fern: ,") ...Mr. Holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound. They had gone a mile or two when they passed one of the night shepherd on the moorlands, and they cried to him..."
2,Fern's Slumber Party/Transcript,30,Mrs. Walters:,) I knew this party was a good idea.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Binky: ,I call my project “Rocks Near School”. These are rocks. I found them near the school. Thank you.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Arthur:,"Er, as you see, the plants grow really well with my vitamin mixture."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine: ,Did you know the average school taco has less protein than a shoe?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Steve:,Er.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"With my invention, chalk will become a thing of the past."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Prunella:,Hm.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,Petit fours?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Judges:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,What an outrage! She's gonna win just because she bribed the judges. This is a science fair. Where's the science in suds and French pastry?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,The laws of science don't apply to Muffy.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,There must be some kind of justice in the world! We can't let Muffy get away with this.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,But what can we do?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,I'm going to get revenge!!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy ):,Lalalala...
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain ):,(laughs)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,Too simple.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy ):,Eek!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,Too complicated.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,"Brain, you have to let this go, or else you'll become some crazy guy living up in the school rafters, dropping chandeliers on people."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,I can't talk to you. I must use all my available brain capacity plotting revenge.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,They haven't even announced who won yet. Who knows? She might lose.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"Yeah, right!"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,"Sometimes, it's better to forgive and forget, be noble, stuff like that."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,The nutritional value of lunch? Who cares? Preserving one's wardrobe is what really matters.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,): What exactly did you have in mind?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,") ""Dear Muffy, I have long admired you. Regardless of the difference in our ages..."" That means he's older!"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Sue Ellen:,Why older? He could be younger.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,"If he was younger, he wouldn't know how to write."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Prunella:,Maybe he's a genius kindergartener.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"Please. ""Regardless of the difference in our ages…”"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Man:,"...I have to make my feelings known. You are so mature, so stylish. I think about you every day.” They both open safe-deposit boxes. Muffy’s contains jewels, his money. / They ride horses. ""Your smile, your laugh, your lack of concern that comes from extreme wealth, the way your clothes stay so crisp and the colors never fade.” They sit in a cheap restaurant and toast with juice cartons. ""I hope that you return my feelings."""
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"""Sincerely, your secret admirer."" ) Maybe he's in the fifth grade."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Prunella:,Any fifth grader who would write a letter like that is nuts!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,He obviously appreciates maturity and nice clothes. They all get up. Let's watch the fifth graders and figure out who wrote the note.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,I can't. I have cafeteria duty.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"Sue Ellen, come on!"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Sue Ellen:,Aw.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,Have you ever realized how frighteningly easy it is to manipulate someone into doing whatever you want?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Arthur:,"Brain, you're acting kind of weird today."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,Am I?? )
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,Why did you and Brain write that note?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,Shh! Not so loud. How did you know it was me and Brain?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,"Only the Brain could use ""regardless"" in a sentence correctly."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,What gave me away? It must have been a really hard to find clue.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,I saw you put it on Muffy's desk.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,Oh.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,"So Brain wrote her that note, now she's running around looking dopey. Isn't that funny?"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,Not really.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,Sue Ellen is trying to steal my secret admirer!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,I had just narrowed down the number of possible secret admirers to twenty when their ball bounced over to us. She kicked it back to them and they asked her to join the game.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,So?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"So my secret admirer's out there. What if he's impressed by her show of brute strength? I need answers! Fern, I'm hiring you as my private investigator. Now, let's go to work."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Arthur:,"And before Muffy Crosswire hired you, you knew who wrote the note."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,I deduced immediately it was Brain and Francine. Of course I had to tell Muffy. My reputation was at stake.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Mr. Ratburn:,That's all the evidence I need to hear. Guilty as charged!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,But it was just a joke... just a joke...just a joke...a joke...
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,We're in trouble. Muffy hired Fern to find out who wrote the note.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,So? She'll never trace it to us.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,She already has!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,She has no proof. I'm too clever to leave clues. It's time to go to phase two: candy and/or flowers. Here! Look! He shows his notebook.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,What's wrong with you? Don't you understand? We're in a big mess.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,At last my plan is complete!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,Hello? Hello? That's funny. That's the third time this happened this week.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"Well, what did you find out?"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,Fern's gonna tell Muffy! Let's confess before it's too late.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,You're overreacting.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,"Er, too many people have been over the crime scene. Any clues have been destroyed."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"Hm, some detective you are! If I'd paid you, I'd be asking for a refund."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Fern:,My reputation is ruined thanks to you.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,Look what a mess this stupid note caused. I wish we'd never started any of this.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,The thrill of revenge seems to be very short-lived.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"Muffy, I'm sorry I allowed myself to get upset about the way you bribed the judges."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,I don't think so.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"Muffy, I'm sorry. I can't let a huge injustice go unpunished."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain+Francine:,Muffy!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,I have important news! I found out who wrote the note and I took some steps.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,What kind of steps?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"I wrote a note back saying that while he has good taste, a love between us can never be. And I put it in his locker."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,And just whose locker is that?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,He's right over there.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Mr. Haney:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,You wrote a note to Mr. Haney?!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"No, silly. Rattles! Poor thing. I know I'm breaking his heart."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,This really is a mess.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,Rattles will pulverize her if he reads that note.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,I warned you. We never should have tried to trick her.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,You tried to warn me?!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,If only you hadn't written Muffy that note in the first place!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,If only you hadn't put it on her desk!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,"Well, come on! What are we waiting for?"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,I can't see anything.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,"I stuck gum to this string. You drop it in the locker, it sticks to the note, we pull it out."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,Let's try this coat hanger. He sticks it in the lockerpl. I've got something! He pulls out half a body building poster. Uh-oh!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,What is that?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"Hold on tight, this is gonna be bad."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Rattles:,"Hey, what're you doing in my locker?"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine+Brain:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,They're here because of me.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Rattles:,"Oh, yeah?"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,It's all my fault.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,And mine.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"We were mad at Muffy and wrote her a fake love note and she thought you wrote it and wrote you a note back and now it's in your locker, but... you probably shouldn't read it."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Rattles+Muffy:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Rattles:,You oughta seen the looks on your faces! You were right. They really did think you put a note in my locker. Oh brother!
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Francine:,"You mean, you knew we wrote the note?"
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"No, but I knew Fern would know who did it. So I followed her and listened to what she said. Then I asked Rattles for a favor. Overall, a very satisfying day."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"Muffy, we're really sorry we wrote the note."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"Well, I can understand why you did it."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,You do?
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,Certainly. You were upset that I'm better than you in science.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,"You may be better at winning contests, but you're not better at science."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Mr. Ratburn:,"All right, everyone. Sit down. It's time to announce the winners for the displays in the science fair. The judges voted for the display that was, well, let's say one of the tastiest."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,"Excuse me, Mr. Ratburn."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Mr. Ratburn:,"Yes, Muffy."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,I just wanted to say that I’ve been thinking...
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,): That's new.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Muffy:,The Brain's project really was more scientific than mine. I’ve decided he deserves the award more than I do.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Class:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Mr. Ratburn:,"Well, that's very noble of you."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Brain:,I guess she's not so bad after all. I feel like a rat.
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Mr. Ratburn:,"Unfortunately, Muffy, you didn't win the contest."
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Class:,)
2,Love Notes for Muffy/Transcript,31,Mr. Ratburn:,The winner of the award for the best entry in the science fair is Francine Frensky for her analysis of bag lunches versus school meals.

2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,How's the car coming?
2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,Brain:,It's been designed for maximum speed and calibrated for low wind resistance and surface friction.
2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,D.W.:,You call that a car? It looks more like a pile of junk on wheels.
2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, D.W., please."
2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,D.W.:,"Mom, that car is not safe. It doesn't have any seatbelts."
2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,Mrs. Read:,"I hate to say it, Arthur, but D.W. has a point. It would probably be safer if you put some seat belts in it."
2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,Brain:,She's right. The design probably could benefit from some sort of additional biomechanical restraint system.
2,D.W. Blows the Whistle/Transcript,32,D.W.:,Better safe than sorry. That's what I always say. Gotta go. I'm heading out on patrol.

2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"If I don't get this next question right, you win. Hey, Brain, is that a break in the time/space continuum?"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,What?? Where??
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,Very funny. You can't delay losing any longer. Here's your question.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,“What is the largest city in France?”
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Paris!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Each basket in basketball is worth two points.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,That's right.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,I win!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,"Wow, you got nine questions in a row right. Congratulations."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Could I get some more lemonade?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,Sure.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,That's called 'Icing the puck'.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,The equator.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,A lobster.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,The Boston Red Sox.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,I win! Wanna play three out of five?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,1945.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Sue Ellen:,"Wait until I ask a question! Hey, that's the right answer."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Er... What a coincidence.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,Arthur sure got good at that game. He never loses.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Sue Ellen:,"If it were anyone but Arthur, I would think he was cheating."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,But Arthur would never cheat.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,)
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, did you finish your homework?"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Almost done!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,You know what's the most exciting thing about winning? It's when you win. I love that feeling!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Kate:,)
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,I win! Let's make it seven out of ten.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,You'll just win again. Let's do something else.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Sue Ellen:,When did you put up all these mirrors?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"Mirrors make a room seem bigger, Sue Ellen."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,I can't help it if I win all the time. I'm just a winner.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Achoo!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"Oh, did you miss? That means I win!"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,You did that on purpose!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"Oh, come on. It's part of the game. If you can't take a little competition, don't play."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,I thought Arthur was a bad sore loser but he's a worse sore winner! I wish he'd go back to losing.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,How? He's on an unstoppable winning streak. He's beaten almost everyone at school at everything.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Sue Ellen:,Everyone but Binky.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,"No one wants to play against Binky, because he cheats."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,"Hey, if Arthur loses at his favorite game, maybe he'll go back to normal. Hey, Binky!"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,"Hey, I hear you're afraid to play that game against me."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Who told you that?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,It was...
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,"...something I thought of all by myself. So, you afraid or what?"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Don't you have anything better to do than watch us play?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Kids:,No!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,") With everyone watching, I'd better not cheat."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,Binky's losing.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,He's creaming you. Why don't you cheat?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,I don't know how to cheat at this game. You've got to know stuff.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,Oh!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,What did he say?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,You don't want to know.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,“What is the third planet from the sun”?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Um... Mars?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,Eh! Wrong!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Kids:,)
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,Alright!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Why are my friends rooting against me?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Fern:,Everyone wants to see you lose because you've been acting like a jerk. Sorry.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Buster ):,You need to talk to me?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,") Buster, everyone hates me. I've been winning games but losing friends. I wish you were here."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Buster ):,You should never have cheated. Cheating at stuff is no good.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,) But what do I do now? Everyone wants to see me lose. How can I lose against Binky? It's impossible.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Buster ):,Cheating got you into this. Why not cheat?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,") Cheat to lose? You mean, like make sure he gets the easy questions instead of me?"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Buster ):,Yeah. You got any food?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,) No.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Buster ):,Then I've got to go. I've got an appointment with a chocolate soda.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,) That's exactly what Buster would have said if he were here.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"Whose turn, is it?"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,I'm waiting for you to ask me a question.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"Oh, my shoe's untied."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"“A four-legged, barking canine?”"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,You mean like dog?
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Correct.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Kids:,Yes!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,A basketball is full of air.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,Dirt.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,The bread around a hot dog is the bun.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,C-A-T.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"Yes, you win."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,Yes!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Kids:,)
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Binky:,"I win. I've beat the champion, now I am the champion. Yes!"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,You beat me.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Kids:,)
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,Er...
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,Arthur! You cheated?!
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Brain:,And you lost anyway.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Sue Ellen:,I hope this teaches you that cheating's not worth it.
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,"Believe me, it sure does. Let's go to the Sugar Bowl and celebrate my losing."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Francine:,"No, let's celebrate everything being normal again."
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur:,") And Buster, I'll never cheat again. I want to thank you for all your good advice.”"
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Arthur's voice:,“I know I couldn't have worked it out without all your help.”
2,Arthur the Loser/Transcript,34,Buster:,Huh??
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Anybody here? D.W. is so easy to fool. She'll believe anything!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur ):,"Like one time, I told her sweaters were a kind of animal."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,I'm not afraid of you!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Sweater:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,Augh!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur ):,And I told her that if you stayed in the tub after you pulled out the plug...
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,Whoa!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur ):,...you'd get sucked in! Heh heh.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"She wouldn't take a bath for weeks. Yup, she'll believe anything."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,Arthur? Did you find anything?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"No monsters. At least, none I noticed. Just try not to think about them and go to sleep."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Augh! )
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,And one time I told her my Bionic Bunny poster could talk and it could tell me if she came in my room when I wasn’t there.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"And she believed you? Wow, it must be great to have someone as gullible as D.W. for a sister."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Is it ever.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,You wanna come over to my house and play “Fool the Mule”?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"Oh sure. Uh, Brain, what's “gullible” mean?"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Easy to fool.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"Oh right. I forgot what it meant. Yeah, that D.W., she sure is gullible."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Hello, partners. How are you doing?"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Fine. What happened to Mrs. Hurley?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"She's gone out of town. Meanwhile, I'm holding down the fort."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"That'll be 10 dollars, please."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur+Brain:,10 dollars?!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Didn't they tell you? New rule. 10 dollars to cross the street. I'll take that in small bills, please."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,But-but we don't have 10 dollars!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"You mean, you expected to cross the street for free?!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"No... but we always did before, sir."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Well, I guess you can pay me later. But don't take too long or I'll send my goons after you."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,10 dollars to cross the street? That's 50 dollars a week!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,I'm lucky I live on the other side.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Piggy Bank:,"""I contain 5 dollars and 37 cents. Oink!"""
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"Arthur, I can't afford to walk home from school."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Muffy:,"Bailey, stop here!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Muffy:,"Brain, where have you been? No one's seen you since third grade."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,I could only cross 5 dollars and 37 cents' worth. This is as far as he would let me come.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Muffy:,"Well, as I always said, if you want service, you have to pay for it!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Wait! I need 4 dollars and 63 cents so I can... get across!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,We can't even pay for today. You think he'll... send his goons?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"Arthur, what are goons?"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,I was gonna ask you that.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Baboons:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,) Who are you?! Are you... the goons?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Baboon:,Of course not. We're baboons. )
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Baboon:,The goons will be along later... Hohohoho! And they're really scary. )
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,This is terrible. He's sending things after us and we don't even know what they are!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,We just have to stay calm and come up with a plan by tomorrow.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,George:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Binky:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"I thought about it all night, Arthur. The mean Crossing Guard is only there in the afternoon, right?"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Right.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,So all I have to find a way home after school. Here are my ideas.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain ):,Plan A. The bridge.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Cartoon Ted:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain ):,Drawback - storing it.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain ):,Plan B. The tunnel.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Cartoon Brain:,Phew!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Cartoon Brain:,Aaaaghhh!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain ):,Drawback - directions.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Cartoon Ted:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain ):,Plan C. The balloon.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Cartoon Ted:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain ):,Drawback - getting blown off course...
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain ):,...crashlanding in a strange country populated by strange creatures... and having to declare myself Wizard.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Cartoon Munchkins:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"Gee, you really thought this out."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"Yeah, but none of my ideas work. I just need a functional plan."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,You sure you don't wanna come over to my house?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,I'd better save my money for when I really need to see you.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Good thinking. Well... )
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Here goes.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Well, here's one half of the Gruesome Twosome. Where's your partner in crime headed?"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,We didn't perpetrate any criminal acts.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,Oh yeah? You sure I haven't seen your mug on a wanted poster someplace? Maybe down at the Post Office?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,N-no!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Well, watch your step now. I'm on to you."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"One false move, boy, and it's into the slammer with you!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,I'm crossing... 10 dollars... Have to get across!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"If only I hadn't crossed the street so many times, my parents wouldn't have had to sell our house."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"Living in a tent might not be that bad, Brain. It might be fun."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,I wonder who bought our house anyway?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,) Home sweet home!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Auuuggghhh!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"Oh, what's the point?! I can't think anymore! If only my parents would simply move across the street!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Mr. Ratburn:,Ahem!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Everything would be fine.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"I'm sure you could stay at our house tonight, Brain. Grandma Thora's baby-sitting and she says yes to anything!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Really?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Mr. Ratburn:,Ahem!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Heh heh.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,I'll go straight to your house and call my parents from there.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,Here they are!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"Oh, we're not crossing the street today, sir. Thank you anyway!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,I hope you two aren't planning to cross at some other stop sign. I got cameras everywhere! I'll catch up to you!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"In theory, it's possible. Cameras can be made quite small, even small enough to fit in this stuffed bear, for instance."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Whoa.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur+Brain:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,You think he has cameras in there?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Could be. Better talk in code.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,The penny jar... sure is mean.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,That's right. It's almost as bad as... the rug.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,What?!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,"Arthur, come check my bed."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"There's nothing under there, D.W. Go to sleep."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,You know things are bad when I don't even feel like torturing D.W.!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"I've got it! Brain, wake up! I know what to do!"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"Could you, Grandma?"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,"Why, of course, Arthur. If you're sure that's what you want."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Yeah! We'll see you after school.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"This was a brilliant idea, Arthur."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,Grandma Thora's cab company at your service! Who needs a ride home?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"It's very nice of you to drive me home, Mrs. Read."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,Why are we stopping?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,There's someone in the crosswalk.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,He sees us!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Duck!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,What's going on back there? Fasten those seatbelts right now!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Shh! Grandma! He'll see us!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,Who? Ted?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,You know him??
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,He's the meanest man in the world.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,"Ted? Oh, he's a pussycat."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,He wants money from us.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,What?! We'll just see about this.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,He sure looks mean.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,He's the meanest crossing guard ever! He said he'd send his goons after us if we didn't pay him money!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,He was going to turn Brain in to the police.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,And he has cameras in all the stop signs.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,"Wow, and you're saying you actually believed all this?! That's the funniest thing I’ve ever heard! ) You guys will believe anything! (laughs)"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Grandma Thora:,"Arthur. Alan. This is Ted Glass. He wants to tell you boys something. Go ahead, Ted."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Well, I just wanted to, er, tell you boys I-I'm sorry if my kidding around gave you two a scare."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Haha. That's all right.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,We didn't really believe it much.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,)
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,I was pretty sure he was joking when he started talking about the cameras.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,"Yeah, you'd have to be pretty gullible to believe that one."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,I guess even smart people believe dumb stuff sometimes.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,Arthur! Come here! Hurry!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"See you tomorrow, Brain. )"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,I think I heard something move down there.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,You'd better watch out. It could be a...
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,A what?! A what?!
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"Actually... actually there aren't any monsters under the bed, D.W. I was just saying that to fool you."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,D.W.:,"Oh, I know that! I've always known that. But... could you check anyway? Pleeease?"
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,"Anyway, I figured it wasn't nice to scare her."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,That's a good idea. She's liable to believe anything.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Hello, boys."
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Hi.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Hello.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Arthur:,Wait. Aren't you gonna ask us the password?
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,That's right! You boys are crossing into enemy territory now.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Brain:,Could be inhabited by goons.
2,Arthur vs. the Very Mean Crossing Guard/Transcript,35,Ted:,"Could be worse, I hear. You'd better watch your step!"
2,D.W.'s Very Bad Mood/Transcript,36,Arthur:,It's really nice when you have a perfect family.
2,D.W.'s Very Bad Mood/Transcript,36,Mrs. Read:,"Here you go, son. A nutritious lunch all neatly packed for you."
2,D.W.'s Very Bad Mood/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"Gee whiz. Thanks, mother."
2,D.W.'s Very Bad Mood/Transcript,36,Mr. Read:,"Son, would you like a ride to school?"

2,D.W.'s Very Bad Mood/Transcript,36,Francine:,"Arthur, are you ready? We've never ever been late for school, and we don't wanna break a perfect record."
2,D.W.'s Very Bad Mood/Transcript,36,Arthur:,"I'll be right there. You see, my life is just about perfect. Except for one little thing."

2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,Maybe she just forgot.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Brain:,Did you read about Muffy?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur+Francine:,We know.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Brain:,"We did all the work, and she got the prize."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,Did anyone see this?! Can you believe it?! These sneakers are on sale!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Read this and weep!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,"What?? I said banana! Banana was my idea! Without me, there's no banana! I'm gonna talk to her!"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Mrs. Crosswire:,"Muffy's not here. She's in town, posing for the bag."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Kids:,The bag?!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Man:,This will be the front of the cookie bag. Muffy made a deal to sell her cookies at the Sugar Bowl.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,She's gonna make money off 'em?!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Muffy Crosswire!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,You're making me wrinkle my nose. No one wants cookies with a wrinkled nose on them. Carl!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Man:,"All right, kids. Clear the studio. Out. Out-out-out-out."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Brain:,"Her Royal Highness gets all the credit, but her lowly subjects did all the work."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,And we're outside with our noses pressed to the window.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,She's gonna be more famous than a doughnut.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Announcer:,Muffy's Cookie Castle is the most successful store in the history of buying stuff!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Announcer:,"Every day, a new Muffy's opens! She is more famous than a doughnut!"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,Here she comes.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,)
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,Hold it right there!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,I'm sorry. There are no samples. You'll have to buy cookies like everyone else.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Buy them?? We made them!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Brain:,I did the math. We're responsible for 72% of the ingredients.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,"I said banana! Banana was my idea! Without me, there is no banana!"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"Oh, yeah? Well, who bought the ingredients? Who owns the oven? Who entered the contest? Moi. You're all just jealous."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,Are we just jealous?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,No. She's a bigger rat than Ratburn!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,Banana was my idea!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"Oh, stop with the banana already!"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"Like I couldn't have won the contest without them. Hm! You'll need to make thousands of cookies, so get started."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Cook:,Okay. As soon as you give me the recipe.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"The recipe? Oh. I don't have it written down. I can remember, though."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,)
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,Eugh!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,Aww! She throws the cookies in the already full trashcan and sits down on the lid. )
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Okay. I wrote out the whole recipe. Now we can make our own cookies and drive that rat out of business.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"Um, guys?"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Did I hear a little rat squeak?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,"No, it's Muffy! She's right there!"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,How would you like to help me make more cookies?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,Banana!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Why don't you just make them by yourself... like you did the last time?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,I'm sorry you feel like I cheated you. Now may I please have the recipe?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Okay.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,"You're going to give us credit this time, right?"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,I don't think that's going to be possible.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,"I don't get it. You're rich, you have everything. Why do you cheat for something like cookies?"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,You don't know what it's like to be me. I have a reputation.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,As a dishonest rat!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,As a winner! I had to prove to everyone I could win it again.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,But you couldn't. We did it together.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,But nobody knows that.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,You know it and we know it.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,"If you care more about cookies than friendship, then go ahead!"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,This is the right recipe?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,Yes.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"You didn't put any tricks in it, so the cookies taste like junk, did you?"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,"Muffy, you can trust us. We're your friends."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,Great. See ya.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,I thought she'd choose friendship. Boy was I wrong!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,"I can't go in the Sugar Bowl anymore, knowing they sell those cookies."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,Wait up! I want you guys to have the first bag of cookies.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,I don't even want to look at those miserable things.
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,"Look, it says “Muffy and Friends”."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,"Wow, neat!"
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,So you finally realized honesty and friendship are more important than winning?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"Yeah. I'm sorry. My dad and I talked about it. He said a lie is a lie, even when you get away with it. And, being a car salesman, he won't stand for any lying. Since these worked out so well, let's start working on my recipe for next year."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Whose new recipe?!
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Muffy:,"Oh right, wait. Our new recipe. I just have to get used to that."
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Arthur:,How about a cake?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Francine:,Or donuts?
2,How the Cookie Crumbles/Transcript,39,Binky:,Banana. Lots and lots of bananas.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"Arthur, did you see the parade?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,Parade? But it's raining out.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,It's a rain parade. The whole marching band is in raincoats and there's a big float shaped like an umbrella. It's right out front.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,There's no parade.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W::,: )
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,D.W.!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,Kate!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Kate:,Oh...
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,Sometimes I really wish I was an only child. Life would be so easy. I could be alone whenever I wanted...
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Kate:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur ):,"In fact, I could use D.W. and Kate's room as my own private library."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur ):,And I'd probably get lots more presents at Christmas.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur ):,"And, best of all, I'd never have to compromise."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,"Now we're gonna watch the Bionic Bunny Special, then a Bionic Bunny rerun, and then this tape of my favorite Bionic Bunny episodes. Okay?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Pal:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"Go straight, Arthur! Straight!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,Oh!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Wow. That looks like fun.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,Not when Arthur is steering. Last time he almost drove me into the lake.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,) I can be your partner for the next race.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,"Sorry, Sue Ellen. It's a brother and sister race."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,Maybe there's a contest for lonely children after this.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,"It's only children, D.W. A lonely child is what you're going to be when I sell you."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Francine:,Give me an “O” and a “D”! What does that spell? Lakewood! And we’re gonna win ‘cause we’re real good.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Francine, have you taken up cheerleading?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Francine:,My sister just taught me some moves. I thought we could use them during our really big games next year.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Catherine:,"Frankie, you have to raise your arms much higher on the O's."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Francine:,Like this?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Francine:,) Stop!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Francine+Catherine:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Crowd:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Tommy:,My turn!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Dad, can I get on your shoulders?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mr. Armstrong:,"Sure, pumpkin."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mrs. Armstrong:,"Oh, honey, watch your back."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Timmy+Tommy:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Mom? Dad? I know what I want for my birthday: a brother or a sister.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mr. Armstrong:,"Oh. Well, if you had a brother or sister we might not be able to go on all our great adventures."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mrs. Armstrong:,Aren’t you excited to go to India this winter?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Yeah, but it'd be a lot more fun with a brother or sister."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Well, Chester, Mom and Dad aren't going to get me a brother, so I guess I'll have to get one myself. But where? I don't think you can buy them."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Binky:,Oww! Stupid bike!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Hmm... I guess Binky could be an older brother. He's big enough.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen ):,"He could certainly help me get ""hard to reach"" things."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Binky:,Allez-Op!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"And best of all, he could give me advice, like whether I should be an artist or an oceanographer when I grow up."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Hey, Binky! Stay right there! I'll give you a hand."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Binky:,An ocean-what?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Oceanographer, Binky. Someone who studies oceans."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Binky:,"That's a dumb thing to study. Why don't you study something cool, like... worms!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Gross! Besides, there's no such thing as a wormographer!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Binky:,"Well, there should be! Hmm... Maybe I can be the first one. Hey, you've given me some great advice. Thanks."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,) Maybe my brother should be a little more helpful.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Brain:,"“35% of the ocean floor is covered with sediment composed of silt, shale and schist.”"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,) I don't think I want to be an oceanographer any more.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Brain:,"I thought you might say that, Sue Ellen. It is kind of dry. So I got this book on different trends in art. From Giotto to Rothko. If we look at chapter 1..."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"This is tough. Maybe I need a boy who already has a sister, so they know the right way to be a brother. Hey... What about Arthur?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,Want to look at my Space Wars cards again?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Forget it! I think it's time to try something new. Like sisters.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Hi, Prunella! Why are you wearing that really strange...?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Prunella:,Shhh! My name is not Prunella. It's Newt. You can be...Toad.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Toad?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Prunella:,"We're playing magic. We have to use special names, or Arcana, Mistress of the Dusk, will be upset."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,Where are my assistants? Arcana is about to lose her cool!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Prunella:,Quickly!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,"For my first trick, I will need a hair scrunchy."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,Make that two scrunchies... in case the first one doesn't work out.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,"Now behold the powers of Arcana, Mistress of the Dusk!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Hey, that's my scrunchy!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,"Quiet, infidel!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Prunella:,"You must believe, Toad. It doesn't work unless you believe!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,"There, mortal. Your head gear is whole again! The trick is complete."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,But this isn't mine.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,"Oh, well, you can have it. A keepsake from the spirit world."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,But I just...
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Rubella:,"I'll be back. Don't move until I return. Lini, tahini, potato, knish! You will do exactly as I wish!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Sheesh!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Prunella, she probably just forgot about us. Can we please do something else now?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Prunella:,Must remain still or be cursed.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mrs. Deegan:,"Ready for some lunch, kids? Egg salad's on the table."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Where's Rubella?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mrs. Deegan:,She went to the movies with some friends.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"See, I told you there was no curse!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Prunella:,What do you mean? I hate egg salad!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Then we had to play what Prunella wanted, just because she's older. I think she's the worst brother or sister I’ve ever had!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mr. Armstrong:,"Er... But honey, she's not your sister."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Oh, I know. I was just pretending."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mrs. Armstrong:,You really want a brother or sister that badly?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,But not an older one. Next time I'm gonna be the boss.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,"Hey, Sue Ellen. You want to try my new video game: Fish Finder 6 with improved graphics."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Actually, Arthur, I'm here to babysit."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,Huh? But everyone's home. We don't need a babysitter.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Oh. Well, could I play with D.W. for a couple of hours."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,What?? Don't you know what D.W. stands for? Disaster Warning!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Her room's upstairs, right?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,) She’s gonna be the perfect little sister. I just know it.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"Wow, you made a swan out of a piece of paper. You can do anything!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"For you, D.W."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,You’re the best sister in the whole world.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,I know.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Oh. Hello, D.W. How are we doing today?"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,Piggy-back.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"You know what, I brought all this pretty colored paper and I thought we’d be able to…"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,Piggy-back!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Okay. I suppose a little ride wouldn’t hurt.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,Yeah!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Oof!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,Woo! Yippie! Faster! Faster! Yeah!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Is your sister always this active?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,She’s just breaking you in.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Back up the stairs, horsey! I wanna go back up!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,"Easy, D.W. She doesn’t know who she’s dealing with."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Hey, D.W., I’ve got an idea. Let’s play “Simon Says”. I'll be Simon. Simon says hands on your hips."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,You said your name was Sue Ellen.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Yes, but now I'm Simon. Now put your hands at your sides. Nope, you lose, because Simon didn't say so."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"Sure you did, Simon."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,I'm not Simon now.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"Well, then who are you? Daddy, there's a stranger in the house!!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Forget it. Forget it. We'll play something else.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,)
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,This is juice! I don't want juice! I want orange soda!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,But orange soda doesn't look like tea and this is a tea party.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"I don't want a tea party! I want an orange soda party! If I don't get orange soda soon, I'm gonna cry! One, two..."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"Here, D.W., I made this paper swan for you. It took me hours."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"Oh, the pretty birdy. I want to see it fly."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,No!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,Oops.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Arthur! I'm sorry! I just can't take it anymore!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,D.W.:,"Sue Ellen, wait! I haven't finished your beauty makeover yet."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,No!!
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,"Actually, she lasted longer than most babysitters."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,") My room! My things! You know, Chester, being an only child may be lonely sometimes, but at least it's safe."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mr. Armstrong:,"Sue Ellen, we’ve got a big surprise for you."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Mrs. Armstrong:,It's a little boy.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Oh no.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,His name is Tenzin. He lives in Tibet.
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Brain:,"Wow, that's so exciting!"
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,"My parents are gonna help him go to school, and he and I are gonna write letters to each other. My mom says I can think of him kind of like a little brother."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,"Well, I think he's the perfect brother, Sue Ellen."
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Sue Ellen:,Why is that?
2,Sue Ellen's Little Sister/Transcript,40,Arthur:,Because he's three thousand miles away.
3,Buster's Back/Transcript,1,Arthur:,Mission Control to Explorer 17. Mission Control to Explorer 17.

3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Buster:,You know how to save Arthur?
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Brain:,"Yeah. Listen, everyone. What we’re gonna do is..."
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Buster:,Maybe he's not coming.
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Binky:,Shh!

3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Muffy:,How darling would this hat be on me?

3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Arthur:,Bionic Bunny Club? Great! What time should I come over?
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Buster:,"You can't come, Arthur. The club's only for Bionic Bunny fans, not Wilbur Rabbit's friends. Sorry, Arthur."
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Muffy:,"They're not acting like me, Arthur. They're acting like you."
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Arthur:,Like... Like... In his imagination he sees himself as Muffy. Don't you have satellite TV?/The club is for friends only./Vomitrocious!/Friends only.
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Arthur:,B-but I...
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Muffy:,"Everyone, listen to me! I didn't mind it when Arthur started copycatting me, but this is too much. I know you all wanna be like me, but there's only one me. I'm sorry."
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Arthur:,Vomitr.... ) He slaps his hand on his mouth. Oh. Everybody looks at him. He jumps into the puddle. (takes deep breath) Ahh!
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Kids:,)
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Arthur:,"Okay, if I play?"
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Buster:,Sure. Nice outfit.
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Brain:,Now let's really play some ball.
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Kids:,)
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Arthur:,I think Muffy's right. One Muffy is more than enough.
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Buster:,Wanna come to my house and watch Bionic Bunny?
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Arthur:,Sure.
3,Arthur Goes Crosswire/Transcript,5,Binky:,"The more I think about it, it's really true. This horrid glove totally clashes with my outfit. Vomitrocious!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,"Arthur:""",""" You know, some people just have to do everything themselves. They..."""
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"Cut, cut, cut! I'm sorry, Arthur, I have to stop you. This is just too boring."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Arthur:,Boring? But...
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"You need a little enthusiasm, more energy... Put a little shape into the line. Remember, this is the opening of the show! He walks back to the camera. Try it again."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"""Some people... just have to do... everything... themselves."""
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,That was it? That's enthusiastic?
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"Yeah. Well...that was practice. ) ""Some people just have to do everything themselves!"" How was that?"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"Tease. Take seven! He runs around the table, now dressed as Arthur, and looks into the camera. ""You know, some people just have to do everything themselves! They won't let anybody help them!"" I think that's much better. Okay. That's a wrap. Cue the title."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,I hope Mr. Ratburn assigns another report today.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Binky:,Are you kidding? We just turned in one yesterday. No way is he gonna give us another report.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,"This report should be at least two pages on any animal of your choosing. Where they live, what they eat and anything that's unusual. The teams for the report will be as follows: Arthur Read and... Muffy Crosswire. Alan, your report partner will be Sue Ellen."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"A model of a dinosaur! That's a great idea, Brain."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,I'll get started on some preliminary sketches.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,What should I do?
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"The sketches have to be done first, that's why they're called preliminary. I'll call you when I'm done with them."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Great! So long.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,I've never done a report with Brain before. It should be fun.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"It'll be easy, that's for sure."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,How do you mean?
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"You'll see, Sue Ellen. Brain is kind of the type that..."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Buster:,Brain's great! He's the best report partner I ever had!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"Well, I'm your partner this time, Buster, and I'm not Brain! If you know what I mean. She grabs him by the sleeve. Come on! We're going to the library."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Mrs. Armstrong:,"Sue Ellen, don't you have any homework to do?"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Not yet. Brain's doing the sketches. They're preliminary. Her mother looks skeptical. She gets off the couch. Well, maybe I'll call him and see how it's going."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,This is gonna be fantastic.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"Even back in elementary school when I was building my first model, I knew that, with a little DNA and a lot of hard work, I would one day succeed. And now, ladies and gentlemen... A tyrannosaurus is raised onto the stage. It lives!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Audience:,)
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"Please, ladies and gentlemen, I implore you, be calm!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Tyrannosaurus:,"Hello, hello, hello! Welcome to the show! Audience members look at each other quizzically. So, I tell you, the strangest thing happened to me. Last night, I discovered an elephant in my pajamas. How the elephant got in my pajamas I'll never know."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Audience:,)
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Hm. I have to work on his material. The phone beside him rings. Hello.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Hi, Brain! I just called to find out how the sketches are going."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Great! Ready to go on to the next stage.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Great. I was getting a little worried that I was just gonna have to sit around and just watch TV all week! What do you want me to do?
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"You?? Er...well, maybe you should... um... continue watching TV. Gotta go do some research. Bye!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Very weird.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,This is our model of a Tyrannosaurus rex.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,And I helped. The arms are made of cookies and the body is made out of cake!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Class:,)
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,"Unfortunately, this isn't a cooking class. You've failed!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,...and then he hung up the phone on me.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"Well, you're lucky. I can't even find Buster! I hope he doesn't think I'm gonna do the whole report by myself!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"I hope Brain realizes I expect to do half the work on this report. I don't mind working. Brain walks by hiding his face behind a newspaper. Brain, is that you?"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,What? No. I mean...
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,That's strange. He vanished.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,That was close.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Buster:,You're telling me! You almost gave away my position.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Fern:,I would deduce that the Brain's probably just strange because he's been working too hard. It could be he's not getting enough sleep.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Ahhh! Must keep working! Must keep working!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Fern:,What are you doing? I thought you were going home.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Brain can't do this report alone!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,Wow! Did Brain ask you for help?
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,No. I'm gonna surprise him.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"Oh, he'll be surprised, alright!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Buster:,Whew! )
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen: ,"Hey, Brain, I came to help you with the research."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain: ,That's all done. Look...
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Wow, that's great! What do we do now, Brain?"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"I need to finish wiring the vertebrae, and then of course the head."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,The head. We can make that papier-mâché!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Um...clay is better.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Okay. I have clay at home. I'll go get started on the head.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Class:,)
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,"I'm afraid you're going to be in third grade for a Loong time, Alan."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,)
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,)
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,I brought the... What's the matter? You look tired.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,) Working late. Come on. I have something to show you.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Voilà.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Er, it looks great. But I thought I was making the head."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,I decided to take care of it. The head's the most important part.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Well, I'm sorry you went through all that trouble for nothing. Here!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,We can't use this.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,What??
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain: ,"The head is all wrong. The proportions of the nasal cavities are way off, and the angle of the bridge is skewed. No, Mr. Ratburn would never accept this."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,They look exactly the same!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Maybe to the untrained eye.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"It's supposed to be our project, Brain, not just yours!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"Yours, mine, ours, I don't have time to argue over silly stuff. I have to work to get this finished. You want a good grade, don't you?"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,“The proportions of the nasal cavities are all wrong. I'm the smartest guy ever.”
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Mrs. Armstrong:,"Honey, are you having a bad dream?"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,No. A bad reality.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Brain, we have to talk! About our report."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,I have everything under control.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"I know. That's the problem! Brain, you're gonna drop it. Let me help."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"No, no. I can do it. Don't touch it."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,That's ridiculous! You're just being a report-hog!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Please! It's very delicate.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Fine. Take it!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"Whoa! He falls in the mud, the model falls apart. Now look what you've done!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,And she let you fall in the mud? ) That sounds hilarious!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,"Believe me, it was far from amusing."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"Well, you're lucky she just let you fall in the mud. If it were me, I would have pushed you."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,What?!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"Well, I'm kind of a rude person. But you... well, you have to admit, Brain. Sue Ellen's right. You're a report-hog. Like last year on our French history report, you were Napoleon and I was France. And you wouldn't even give me any lines."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Shh!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine: ,"Even when we were little, you always had to do everything. Brain draws a mouth in Buster's painting. And how would you like it if Sue Ellen treated you the way you treated her?"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Don't touch that! You're fiddling with my precious “A+”. You don't know what you're doing. Go home!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,I guess... I guess I would feel pretty bad if somebody didn't trust me to work on our report.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Well, I'm sorry I called you a report-hog."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Now we don't even have a report to hog. Our model is wrecked.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Maybe. But our report will be better than ever.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,How?
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Trust me.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Okay.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Muffy:,...the largest mammal on Earth.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Mr. Ratburn:,Very good. Well done. Alan and Sue Ellen will report next.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,Mr. Ratburn. Can we all go outside? Brain and I set up a special demonstration for our report.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Binky:,Alright! Field trip!
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,We have recreated what paleontologists might find when they discover dinosaur bones.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Arthur:,"Wow, Brain! This is cool."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,It was really Sue Ellen.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Sue Ellen:,"Now you can all dig them up if you want. But there is a proper way to do it, and Brain will show you how."
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Brain:,Sue Ellen's right. You must be very careful.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Buster:,This is gonna take all day.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,That means we'll have time to finish our report after school.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Buster:,Okay. I'll meet you at your house.
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,"Oh, no, you won't!"
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Buster:,Huh?
3,Sue Ellen and the Brainasaurous/Transcript,6,Francine:,We're sticking together until it's done.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,"Hi, Hal. How's it going, boy?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,3W:,") Look out, R4!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,3W!!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mother:,And I got the kids’ mittens on sale for only three million dollars!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,"Mom, 3W deleted my hologram!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mother:,Why don't you do your homework instead of fighting with 3W?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Computer:,Homework done.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,3W:,"R4, will you play virtual flingy with me? Please, please, please, pleease?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,"All right, quit gleebing!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,)
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,3W:,Stop throwing it so hard. You're hurting me!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,"No, I'm not! It's all in your imagination."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mother:,"All right, you two. I want you to sit on the barkazoid and watch a datagram."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,What is it?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mother:,It belonged to your great-grandfather. They used to call them videos. You can see what life was like in ancient times.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mr. Ratburn:,"For next week, I'd like you to research your family history and present it to the class. I found out some very interesting things about the Ratburns. As we can see, the Ratburn line can be traced far back into history."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Napoleon Ratburn:,Travaillez plus! Travaillez plus! [Subtitle: Work Harder! Work Harder!]
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Arthur:,What?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Ratburn Caesar:,Laborate plus diligente! [Subtitle: Work Harder!]
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mr. Ratburn:,And so I’ve learned that the Ratburns wouldn't be where they are today without a lot of hard work. Let's see what you find out.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"I can't wait to get started. I bet that I'll find lots of kings, queens and princesses in the Crosswire family."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Yeah, I'm sure I'll find some really famous Frenskys. Maybe one was a really important explorer. She has a fantasy of an older version of herself riding in a canoe. What if my great-grandmother discovered the land route to the Pacific Ocean?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Sorry, Francine, but I think Lewis and Clark did that."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Oh, well. Maybe she helped them."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Clark:,") have to stop, Lewis. I can barely move my arms."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Lewis:,"You said it, Clark. I'm bushed."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Clark:,A bear! We're done for!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Lewis:,"You're right, Clark! This is the end!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Ma Frensky:,"Keep your shirts on, boys!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Lewis+Clark:,It's Ma Frensky!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Ma Frensky:,)
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Lewis+Clark:,)
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Ma Frensky:,"One, two, three, four, five... six, seven, eight, nine, ten! I win! She and the bear get up and shake hands. Then the bear leaves. Now I want you boys to follow this route till you hit the Pacific Ocean."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Lewis:,Great idea!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Clark:,Why didn't we think of that?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Ma Frensky:,"And stay out of trouble, you hear?!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,I bet my ancestor gave your ancestor a medal for being so brave. He was probably the president at the time.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Oh yeah? Well, I bet my relatives were the presidents before and after him."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Arthur:,"You guys, it's not a contest."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,"Yeah, I'm sure we're all related to some really interesting people."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,Grandpa was a tollbooth operator? Wow! And what did his father do?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mrs. Baxter:,) I don't know what my grandfather did. I never asked him. Now I really wish I had.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,I'll check in the library. I bet I can find some stuff about him there.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Arthur:,Cool! My great-uncle owned a cheese shop. That makes three uncles I found so far.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,Gee. I'd settle for a second cousin. I haven't found anything about my ancestors.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Hi, guys. Do you know where the Crosswire section is?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Arthur:,Huh?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,Huh?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Oh, never mind, I'll just ask Miss Turner."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Miss Turner:,"No, I'm sorry. We don't seem to have any books on the Crosswires."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,But this is a library. You're supposed to have books on important people.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Hey, Muffy. Guess what I just found out. My grandfather owned a castle."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,Really?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,Yep. There's an article on it in this paper. What d'you find out?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Oh, the Crosswires are too important to be in this public library. We have our own private archives."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"This is it? But where are the books about us, and what about the family jewels?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mrs. Crosswire:,"Oh, there's nothing like that. We're just plain folks, honey."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Mother, how can you say such a thing?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mr. Crosswire:,"You should visit your great-aunt, Olga Crump. She'll know some interesting things about the family."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,It's my grandfather's lunchbox. My mom found it last night.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Arthur:,At least now you have a visual aid.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,"Yeah, for the world's shortest report! I can't even open it. It's stuck."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Hi, guys! How's the report going, Francine?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,Great! I just learned that my grandfather's grandfather was an adviser to President Lincoln.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Oh... Well, I'm off to visit my great-aunt. She's a princess. Bye! The limousine drives on. It wasn't really a lie. She could be a princess. Wait a minute! She's too old to be a princess. She'd have to be a queen! And if she's a queen then maybe I'm... a princess!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"I'm sorry I'm late, Your Highness. The limo had a flat."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Queen Olga:,"Is that you, Anastasia?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,No. It's Muffy!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Queen Olga:,"Ah, well, you'll do. Crown her!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,So I'm actually the long-lost princess of Translatvia? Cool!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,Oh no! Are you sure this is the right address?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Olga Crump:,"The Crosswires used to sell used horses, and after that it was used carts. And now it's used cars! ) She holds up a garden gnome. Er, this is Juniper. I thought you might want him for your report."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,Thanks. Francine probably has something from Abraham Lincoln!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Grandpa Frensky:,"And Vingal Frensky advised Abe Lincoln to trim his beard, and guess what, he did! Want the photo to show your class?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Oh, that's all right, Grandpa. I'll, um, describe it to them."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Grandpa Frensky:,How about this one? It's of the Hamburger Castle I used to own.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,Hm... okay.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Grandpa Frensky:,I have more stuff in the garage. I think there's a box up there with some of Lincoln's beard.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,There. Now it looks like the type of castle Muffy's family might have. I'll say the bottom was cut off.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"And then the Crosswires owned all of England and France, too! But they sold that to the Germans."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,Get this. I have a picture of my grandpa standing outside his own castle.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,We owned a hundred castles!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,A Frensky advised Lincoln!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,So? Lincoln was my second cousin!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,I think my ancestors were all taken away on a spaceship. That's why I can't find any.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Oh please, Buster. That makes everything I've said sound believable!"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,I knew it!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Ohh, it's no use! None of my relatives were rich or famous. The Crosswires were just... plain folks."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"That's okay, Muffy. I bet they're still pretty interesting."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,"Easy for you to say. Your relatives actually did exciting things, like own castles and advise presidents. I mean, they really did do those things, right?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Oh, yeah. Definitely. My ancestors were all really important people."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Grandpa Frensky:,"Hiya, Frankie. I found some more photos for you. There are some terrific pictures of the inside of the Hamburger Castle."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Uh... thanks, Grandpa."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Grandpa Frensky:,"My pleasure, Frankie. I'm sure it's going to be a great report. Make the Frenskys proud. Goodnight."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,"Goodnight, Grandpa. He walks out. Francine takes out the scissors. Oh. Grandpa would be really hurt if he knew I was trying to make the Frenskys seem more exciting. Maybe I should just tell the truth."
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,Here's my grandfather making a hamburger. Here he is mopping. This is a picture of a salt shaker.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Class:,)
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,) And I thought my relatives were boring!

3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Wolf Blitzen:,"And so, from covered wagons to Cadillacs, the Crosswires have kept the transport industry alive and thriving in the United States for over a hundred years. And that's the way it was. This has been Wolf Blitzen. Thank you and good day."

3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,A lot of my relatives were really important. But the most important one was Vingal Frensky. He was an advisor to Abraham Lincoln. I will now give you a dramatic recreation of one of their really important conversations.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Grandpa Frensky:,Francine!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,)
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Grandpa Frensky:,"Sorry to interrupt, folks.  Here, Frankie. You left this at home and I thought you might need it."

3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Class:,)
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Mr. Ratburn:,Fascinating.

3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Francine:,Yeah.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Muffy:,You're such a good friend!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Buster:,I thought all I'd have to show you would be my grandfather's lunchbox and my report would be boring. But then I found this sandwich inside. He takes it out. It's from 1955! He takes a bite. Mmm! Baloney!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,Class:,Eugh!
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,3W:,Is that really what life was like a hundred years ago?
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,I guess so.
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,3W:,"I liked it. But it didn't make a lot of sense. I mean, what's a hamburger?"
3,Background Blues/Transcript,7,R4:,Beats me!

3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Brain:,I won't even think about it. I'm working on a project for the science honor roll. That's more important to me.
3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Arthur:,"I'm not thinking about it either. He sees himself playing a grand piano inside a toolbox. Well, see ya!"

3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Arthur:,Really?
3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Francine:,Believe me. I know people. Behind all that confidence he's secretly shy.

3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Francine:,There's no reason you shouldn't be confident in yourself.
3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Brain:,I am confident.
3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Francine:,He's not. He just won't admit it.
3,And Now Let's Talk to Some Kids/Transcript,8,Arthur:,It's okay if you're afraid to go on TV.

3,The Chips Are Down/Transcript,9,Nadine:,You'd better tell your mom.
3,The Chips Are Down/Transcript,9,D.W.:,"I can't. She told me not to do it. If these are my last days of life, I don't want Mommy mad at me. Hey! Maybe Arthur was fooling. Do you know if the green ones are really poison?"
3,The Chips Are Down/Transcript,9,Nadine:,I don't know anything you don't know.
3,The Chips Are Down/Transcript,9,D.W.:,Right. I've got to find out. I've got to ask someone who'd know.

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,No-one would hear the poem over the music.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,Oh. I guess you're right.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,"Okay, here's the stuff from my dad."
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,I've made my own home versions of each of these. It's really easy!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,Hey this isn't my stuff! These are Catherine's! We must have taken each other's backpacks!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,What's this? “Popular Girl”?
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Girls:,Oh!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,This is a teenage girls' magazine.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,They have all sorts of strange and mysterious articles.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,"""Get a prom date in twelve days or less."" What's a prom?"

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,Not me!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Muffy:,"I can't wait till I'm old enough to know what they're talking about, so I can do everything they say. Then I'll be just like that model! The page shows a model wearing a flower pot as a hat. )"
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Brain:,"Hey, is that Popular Science? Oh. Never mind."
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,"Look, here's a quiz. ""How likable are you?"""
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,Let's take it. I bet these tests are really scientific.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,"We don't need a dopey test to tell us if people like us. Come on, guys!"
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,"Question one: ""If you were a sandwich, your friends would be: A) potato chips, B) diet soda, C) the plate, D) hungry."""

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Girls:,)
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,"Well, that's the end of that."
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,That test was weird! Who thinks of their friends as potato chips?!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,It was written for teenagers. They think differently.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,It's kind of scary.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,Sometimes I look at Catherine and her friends and think about being their age. I can't fall asleep for hours!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,What are you doing?
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,Oh! She drops the magazine. I kind of wanted to see how likable I am. Aren't you curious?
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,No. Well...maybe a little.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,"Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven... I scored twelve! ""If you scored less than twenty, you are too quiet. Nobody can like you because nobody knows you're there."" It's my worst nightmare!"

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Buster:,"Oh, what's the point?! I'll never be as good as Sue Ellen!"
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,I'm frightened by her excellence!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Binky:,I might as well stick my tongue in a drawer and never blow again!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,But I don't get it! We have friends! Why do they like us?
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,"Well, this magazine is for teenagers, so it must be predicting the future, our future."

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,We have to change now or we'll be friendless for the rest of our lives!

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,Ohh.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Binky:,This victory feels... hollow.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,But don't you feel good about yourself?

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,"Sue Ellen, weren't you going to show us how to make idiot phones?"
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,"Idiophones! I mean, that's what I thought the word was. I'm probably wrong. She looks annoyed. Francine has bent a metal pipe into a knot. She strikes it with a screw to produce a sound. )"
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,Is this right?
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,Er...yes! Excellent.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,Ow!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,"Okay, potato chips! I've decided I'm reading a poem! You can accompany me."
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Arthur:,Wait! When did we decide that?

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,"We're so good at being likable, everyone hates us."

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,"You mean, you did all this because of that stupid magazine?"
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,It said we weren't likable.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Buster:,Did you answer that your friends were diet soda? That might have thrown off your score.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Francine:,That magazine is just goofy.

3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Brain:,Success! )
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Binky:,Greeks rule and Trojans drool!
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Sue Ellen:,I can't believe we acted so dumb! I like being good at what I do.
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Fern:,And I can't stand telling people what to do. How could anyone take a silly test like that seriously?
3,Popular Girls/Transcript,15,Mr. Ratburn:,"""If you scored over two hundred..."" Oh, I have a lot of work to do. According to this, I don't give out enough homework!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,"Everybody's gotten really upset by something at least once. Like the time D.W. lost her blankie. Or when D.W. lost her CD of ""Crazy Bus"". Or when D.W. lost her snowball. Small screens appear showing excerpts from other episodes in which D.W. is yelling. Arthur covers his ears. Okay, maybe D.W. is upset more than most people. Bad example."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,A good example is Francine. That time she hit a high fly with three men on base. It looked like a grand slam and she'd won the game for us. Then the wind shifted.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Outfielder:,Yeah!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,She was really upset.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Francine:,I can't believe this! Oh!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,"Then there was the time the Brain got so excited about the space probe headed for Saturn. Brain passes Arthur and Buster. Is something wrong, Brain?"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Brain:,I just found out the probe won't get to Saturn for seven years. How can I stand waiting seven years to see photos of Saturn?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,"But I know one person who's always happy. He's never been upset for more than three seconds. He pulls a rope and the curtains reveal a grumpy looking Buster. Buster Baxter, the happiest, jolliest, most fun... What's wrong?"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,Hmph!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,What is it? Buster!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Bionic Bunny:,"If I don't get free, I won't be able to deliver that box of medicine in time!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Mrs. Baxter:,"Buster, did you write your report before watching TV?"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Yeah, almost. Well, actually, no."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Mrs. Baxter:,You know our homework policy.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,Okay. The Bionic Bunny episode has just ended. Oh! How did he get out?!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,So how did Bionic Bunny get free?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,I missed the show. I was working on my history report.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Mine's kind of weak. I, I did it sort of fast after Bionic Bunny. But I came up with a great joke for it!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,For your history report?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Yeah! On TV, this ad said that the difference between a successful speech and a failure is to start with a joke. I wish I had a couple of guys to try it out on. They have reached the school steps. Binky, can I try a joke on you?"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,Sure. I like to laugh as much as much as the next guy.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Boy:,"Oh, dear. Oh, my. Oh."

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,You made that up? Good one.

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"It was mine. My joke! He told my joke! Everybody looks at him expectantly. In his imagination the others’ heads turn into large eyes. Er...my report is about King Tut. Hey, what do you call two banana peels?"

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Francine:,"If you wanna go skating tomorrow, my sister will take us."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,He told my joke. It was mine! I made it up and everything.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,Binky shouldn't have done that.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Francine:,"He was wrong to do it. So, wanna go skating tomorrow?"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,He told my joke!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Mr. Ratburn:,You're gonna have to work a little harder next time.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,) Ohh...
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,"No matter how fancy you make a 'D', it's still a 'D'."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"D for ""disaster"", D for ""deadly"", D for ""Binky told my joke”."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,That joke was the difference between a successful report and a flop. Just like the TV said.

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,It was my joke!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,Binky's report was about Columbus. Who ends a Columbus report with a joke about King Tut?!

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,What's wrong?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Everyone's laughing, just like when he told the joke. Everyone thinks Binky's funny."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,So what if people think he's funny?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,Binky doesn't care about funny. It's me who cares about funny. It's me who memorizes joke books and practices making faces in the mirror! He makes a funny face at Francine. I have to work at it. You know how long I worked on that King Tut joke?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Francine:,A lot longer than you worked on your report!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Yeah, but Binky... He puts a whole banana in his mouth. Haven't you noticed that anything he does seems kind of...funny?"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,You're spending way too much time thinking about Binky.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,It won't matter after the talent show tomorrow. I'll show him! He'll be sorry he stole my joke.

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Mr. Ratburn:,"Thank you, Sue Ellen, for that demonstration of... pumpkin kicking. And now the comedy stylings of Buster Baxter!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Francine:,"At least while he's telling jokes, Buster won't be talking about Binky!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,I think he's gotten over it.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Hi, everyone. There's a kid in my class named Binky Barnes."

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Nobody has a bad thing to say about Binky, because they don't want to get pounded. Binky wrote a history report about Columbus. Columbus, that's Italian for ""Boy, am I lost!"" I wrote a report about King Tut and I wrote a good King Tut joke to open my report with, but Binky told my King Tut joke in his Columbus report. Everybody laughed. But you know what the punch line was? He told my joke that I wrote and I got a D!"

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"That was the comedy of truth. All the greats do it. Oh, I should have just told jokes. This is all Binky's fault!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,I don't think Buster's ever gonna stop holding this grudge against Binky!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,"Wow, our first day of college, Buster! Isn't it exciting?!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Binky's not here, is he? He told my joke! It was a good joke."

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,Buster! You can't stay mad at Binky forever! It doesn't do any good!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Yes, it does! If I keep it up, I'll make sure Binky gets a D and is totally miserable all the time!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,That's exactly what's happening to you! Don't you see how holding a grudge is only hurting you! You've been mad since Binky told the joke!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Arthur, I know what you're trying to say."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,You do?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"You're saying, the only way I could be happy is if Binky never told that joke in the first place."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,"Yeah, and it's too late for that."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"So, to stop him, I must travel back through time and change the past."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,What??
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,I need a time machine. Or a rocket that can travel faster than light speed around the sun.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Arthur:,"You can't change the past, Buster!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Oh, can't, can't I?!"

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,Yeah?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,That's silly! Staying mad all the time won't get you what you want.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"It's just that, after all the work I did on that report, Binky ruined it!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,That's not my fault! They put it right next to Egypt in the encyclopedia! I guess it was my fault. I deserve a D. Binky rides over the bridge on roller skates. Binky! Hey!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,Whoa!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,I just wanted to tell you I'm not mad anymore.
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,You were mad?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"Yeah, about you stealing my joke."

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,What does King Tut say when he gets scared? I want my mummy!

3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,You heard it when you stole it from me and told the class!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,"When somebody tells you a joke, you're supposed to tell it to someone else, right?"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,But I made it up for my report and then you used it without asking! That's like stealing!
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,"Oh, I didn't mean to steal it. Here's, um... He empties his pocket. ...seventy... seventy-three cents and a sticker of a cool car and a button. He gives them to Buster. That's all I have. Sorry!"
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,"He gave me seventy-three cents, a sticker of a cool car and a button for my joke. I got paid for writing a joke! I'm a professional! Woohoo! He runs after Binky. With your being naturally funny and me making up good jokes, I bet we can really go places."
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,Like my own TV show?
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Buster:,Sure. You and me and Arthur...
3,Buster's Growing Grudge/Transcript,16,Binky:,"Us, maybe. But I don't think Arthur. Who'd want to watch him on TV?"
3,Arthur's Treasure Hunt/Transcript,17,Galileo:,"But father, it's only eight o'clock! Can't I discover one more moon of Jupiter? Please?"
3,Arthur's Treasure Hunt/Transcript,17,Galileo's Father:,"It's always one more moon of Jupiter, and before you know it, it's the whole Milky Way! You've got the entire renaissance to discover the moons of Jupiter, Gali. It's past your bedtime. Now get into your jammies, please!"
3,Arthur's Treasure Hunt/Transcript,17,Galileo:,Aw...
3,Arthur's Treasure Hunt/Transcript,17,Isaac:,Ow!
3,Arthur's Treasure Hunt/Transcript,17,Isaac's Father:,Stop moping around! Do you expect ideas to fall from the sky?
3,Arthur's Treasure Hunt/Transcript,17,Isaac:,)
3,Arthur's Treasure Hunt/Transcript,17,Arthur:,Cool.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,Whoa! This fair is so cool! It's just like being in the Middle Ages.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,Stick with your partner and take notes on all the historical details. They'll be useful when we compete in the games.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Scotsman:,Get your haggis here! Fresh haggis! Two for a dollar!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,"""Haggis - two for a dollar."" What's haggis?"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"There it is - the Golden Gryphon, the award given to the class which exhibits the greatest knowledge of medieval history."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,Boy! Mr. Ratburn sure wants to win that Golden Gryphon!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"We came so close to winning last year. If we all try our hardest, I'm sure this is the year we finally win."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,"I bet we can win, because what class on Earth does as much homework or works as hard as we do."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Glenbrook students:,"""Glenbrook! Glenbrook! That's our school! Glenbrook! Glenbrook! We will rule! Go, Glenbrook!"""
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,It can't be!

3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"Mr. Pryce-Jones, my old teacher! I didn't know you were still at the Glenbrook Academy?"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"They won't let me quit. After all, I am irreplaceable."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,Huh...?
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,)
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Brain:,"Oh, no!"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"Bath, Sienna, Avignon, we've won all the medieval fairs in Europe. This little one should be a snap."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buffy:,"Excuse me, sir, but it's ten-fourteen."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"Well, time to prepare. See you at Merlin's Labyrinth, Ratburn. Don't get lost along the way! )"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,Have we ever played soccer against those guys? They seem kind of familiar.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,No way! I'd remember a weird-looking bunch of kids like that.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Merlin:,"The first to escape a point shall win, the other one shall perish within."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"Remember, Chester, navigate by the sun and the tops of the trees."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"Arthur, use your head."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Merlin:,"On your mark, get set, hie thee hence. Chester runs into the maze. That means “go”, kid!"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,"Oh, no! Dead end! He sees his shadow on a wall. Hmm! My shadow! ) Oh! He falls backwards through the maze’s cloth wall. He gets up and rubs his head. I guess I really used my head."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Sword Man:,He or she who pulls the sword from the stone truly is our king or queen. 'Tis an equal opportunity sword. Keep the line moving! Arthur goes to the sword. All your might won't set things right. ‘Tis a gentle hand will rule the land.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,)
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,Arthur! Everyone's looking for you! We lost at Merlin's Maze. Time for the next competition.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,Let's see you beat that! Colleen licks the sucker cup on her arrow and shoots it right above Francine’s arrow. It slides down and pushes Francine’s arrow out of the bullseye. )
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"Quick, lads and lasses! V = u + a t. Now!"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Lakewood Students:,)
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"I see they don't know Newton's formula for constant acceleration yet. The clocks are ticking, Ratburn."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,We're getting pulverized! We might as well just give them the Golden Griffin.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,It's not our fault that we’re playing robots.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,"I feel sorry for them, having that guy for a teacher."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"Actually, Buster, Mr. Pryce-Jones was the best teacher I ever had. Some people say I'm a tough teacher..."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,No.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,Who says that?
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,...but Mr. Pryce-Jones made us learn Latin in third grade.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Students:,"Sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt. [I am, you are, he/she is, we are, you are, they are.]"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,Again!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Students:,"Sum, es, est, sumus, estis, sunt."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"And at recess, he pushed us to the limits of our strength."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Glenbrook Students:,Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup! ...
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,I learned a lot. It makes me wonder sometimes if I'm not a tough enough teacher.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,Mm! This capon is good. It tastes just like chicken.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Rusty:,Capon is chicken!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Glenbrook Students:,)
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,I have an extra helping of figgy pudding for the student who can answer a trivia question.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Glenbrook Students:,)
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"Commendable enthusiasm, children. But let's give Lakewood the first try. Who was the sixteenth king of England? The Lakewood students look clueless. What? You mean you haven't taught them the song, Ratburn? Mr. Ratburn sinks down in his seat. Winky, C-sharp, please. Winky blows a pitch pipe. ) “Here's a song that's more historical than musical / to teach the kings of England in the order categorical."" Arthur looks at his watch. Twenty minutes pass. ""And now you know a wondrous thing / all forty-two English kings!”"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Glenbrook Students:,)
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"I know you don't agree with all of my teaching methods, Ratburn, but you have to admit, they're more effective. The fact is, you can't beat us."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"You may be right, sir."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,"Did you hear that? If we keep losing, Mr. Ratburn may start teaching us like that guy! We have to win something."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,How? We can't beat them. Mr. Pryce-Jones just said so and he's always right.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,"Well, there must be something here we're good at. He looks at the list of events. Aha!"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,"A mincemeat-pie eating contest. This should be no sweat, Buster. Are you hungry, champ?"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,Yeah. Good thing I didn't win that figgy pudding.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Monk:,"On your mark, get set...tuck in!"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,Must...eat...more! Oh! He pushes the rest of pie away and slumps on the table. Rusty is still eating. I don't understand. How can you keep eating? Where does it all go?
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Rusty:,"Over the past few weeks, I've expanded my stomach with giant breakfasts. I now have an eighteen-liter capacity. Could you pass the ice cream, please?"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,Ugh!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,We’re so lucky they had tennis in the Middle Ages. Muffy's been playing since she was five.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Muffy:,Huh?! This isn't a regulation tennis ball! It weighs a ton!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buffy:,"It's what they played with in the 16th century, like this racquet."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Muffy:,That piece of junk?! It looks like it could have been used by Henry VIII!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buffy:,It was used by Henry V. He was my great-great-great-great-great-great uncle.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,"You can do it, Brain! I know you can! No-one's smarter than you!"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Jester:,"The wheel of Fortuna is constantly spinning. Someone is losing and someone is winning! The wheel stops at 20. All right. For twenty points, what do all the planets revolve around?"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Brain:,The sun! That was easy.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Jester:,"I'm sorry, but the correct answer is the Earth. Those points go to IQ."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Glenbrook Students:,Hip-hip-hooray!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Brain:,Huh? But that's wrong!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Jester:,You have to give the answers that were thought correct during the Middle Ages.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,"Well, that's it. We've lost for sure now. Might as well get something to eat."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,Eat?? You just had six pies!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,I feel empty inside.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,You go ahead. There's something I want to do.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,Grr... Why...won't you...move?
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Haney:,"After seeing your results, Mr. Pryce-Jones, I know the children would benefit if you taught them."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"Well, it's a generous offer. I'll definitely consider it."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,"Hey, Arthur! Wanna try a unicorn dog? It tastes like capon."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,I just heard Principal Haney talking with Mr. Pryce-Jones and I think he wants to replace Ratburn with him!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Muffy:,It's because we’ve lost every single game. We’ve disgraced Mr. Ratburn.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,Mr. Pryce-Jones will probably hold us back for years so he can teach us over and over again.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,"All that's left is a castle-building contest. If we win that, maybe Mr. Haney will reconsider."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Bishop:,Hmm. Excellent crenellations.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,Huh? Francine nudges him. Oof!
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Bishop:,"Smooth! Well, I must say, this is a very creative piece of work."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Arthur:,He really likes it. I think we won.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Bishop:,"But unfortunately, the contest is for the most historically accurate castle, therefore I must award the prize to Glenbrook."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Glenbrook Students:,)
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"You see, these arrow slits are much too wide. And in Old English, ""Lakewood"" would have an E on the end."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"I just want you all to know, I'm very proud. I'm going to have this castle put on display at school."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,Mr. Ratburn doesn't even know he's being replaced.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Muffy:,I feel so sorry for him.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,Him?! What about us? My brain hurts just thinking about Mr. Pryce-Jones.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Francine:,Hey! Where's Arthur?

3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Pryce-Jones:,"Arthur out-thought not only all my students, but even me! I couldn't budge that sword! He shakes Mr. Ratburn’s hand. You taught that boy to think for himself. I couldn't have done it better."
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,"Principal Haney, is Mr. Pryce-Jones still gonna be our teacher instead of Mr. Ratburn?"
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Haney:,Of course not! The only ones Mr. Pryce-Jones will teach at Lakewood are my niece and nephew. He's going to be their private tutor.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Buster:,I'm glad we don't have a really tough teacher like that Mr. Pryce-Jones. I bet he gave those kids homework tonight.
3,The Return of the King/Transcript,18,Mr. Ratburn:,"Homework? Thanks for reminding me! We lost a whole day of class. We need extra homework. I'd like a written report on medieval times by Monday, then perhaps a quiz on the rulers of England..."

3,Attack of the Turbo Tibbles/Transcript,19,Mrs. Read:,Can we think of something quieter for you to do? Arthur has a lot of homework. Maybe a game?
3,Attack of the Turbo Tibbles/Transcript,19,Tommy and Timmy:,*simultaneously* TV! TV!
3,Attack of the Turbo Tibbles/Transcript,19,Mrs. Read:,How about a video?
3,Attack of the Turbo Tibbles/Transcript,19,D.W.:,That one.

3,Attack of the Turbo Tibbles/Transcript,19,Mrs. Read:,You must have extra difficult homework to be working this hard.
3,Attack of the Turbo Tibbles/Transcript,19,Arthur:,"No, I just wanna finish it extra fast so I can watch Secrets of Magic on TV tonight. They're gonna tell how all the best trick are done. Maybe I'll learn how to make D.W. disappear."
3,Attack of the Turbo Tibbles/Transcript,19,Timmy:,I never thought about feet this much before. They're weird!

3,What Scared Sue Ellen?/Transcript,23,Francine:,Yeah. How did you think up something so cool?
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Announcer ):,The mummy was surrounded by his finest treasures.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Arthur:,"If I was a mummy, I know which of my treasures I'd want."

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,Some treasures. I'd have real treasures!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,All the paper from my Christmas and birthday gifts. My favorite stuffed animals. My acorn collection. My button collection. I had a snowball but somehow it disappeared!

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,I am now mummy ready!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,"If we walk out quietly, we won't have to ask."

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Grandma Thora:,"Maybe Clarissa would like a vacation from that musty old cabinet. How would you like to take care of her for a week, D.W.?"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Oh, thank you, Grandma!"

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Arthur:,Is the show over?
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,No. Intermission. Rapunzel fell out of the castle and broke her neck. This is much more exciting than the version Mom told me.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"I am Rapunzelaria, princess of the second layer of sky! I am flying to my cloud castle! Watch me fly away, loyal followers!"

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,"But D.W., she's a mess!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Yeah, I've played with her a lot. Maybe we should get Grandma a new one."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mrs. Read:,"But D.W., Clarissa's old!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Then she won't mind that it broke! Oh, good."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,"No, she's old old - unique - and very special to Grandma Thora. Here, I'll show you."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,"Now, when Grandma Thora was your age, D.W., the world was a very different place."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Arthur:,She must have lived in a really small town.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,That's right here in Elwood City. That's Grandma Thora with her brothers.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,Everyone in our family got stuck with brothers. How sad!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,"Actually, Thora's brothers are part of the reason she ended up getting Clarissa."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,"Momma, may I go across the street and look in the toy-store window?"

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Lady:,"How are you today, Thora?"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Policeman:,"This way, young Thora!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Lady:,Again? I can't believe we're under the flight route for that zeppelin! It's getting so a person can't have any peace and quiet!

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,"Victoria, how nice of you to come. Guinevere, your castle is beautiful. Much nicer than mine."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,Hmph!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Brother 2:,"Thora, you said you wanted a horse-drawn carriage. So here it is."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,This is an airplane!

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,Argh!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora's Mother:,"Is something wrong, honey?"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,I hate playing with my brother's hand-me-downs. Why can't I have my own toys?
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora's Mother:,"Maybe when you're older. Toys are expensive, Thora, and girls your age aren't very careful."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,"Oh, I'd be very careful, Mother!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Brother 1:,"Thora, I've made you a fairy-godmother doll."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,I'm not playing with a potato!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Brother 1:,"Gee, I think it's a good idea."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora's Mother:,Hmm.

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora's Mother:,And now that you're one year older...
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,A doll! A real doll!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,I'm going to take care of you for the rest of my life!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,Grandma kept Clarissa perfect her whole life and I wrecked her! What am I going to do?!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mrs. Read:,Let's try the doll hospital.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mrs. Read:,“Gone on vacation. See you in a month. Bill.”
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,What kind of a doctor goes on vacation when there are dolls in trouble?!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mrs. Read:,Good news. I searched the internet and I've found another place that fixes old dolls. I e-mailed them.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,We're saved!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mrs. Read:,And there's a six-month wait.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Oh, no!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Read:,Grandma Thora called. She's dropping a travel column off with Bitzi Baxter and thought she'd stop by for dinner.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,But we can't fix Clarissa by tonight! Now Grandma Thora will find out what a bad granddaughter I am! She'll probably fire me.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,Look! I tied this ribbon around Clarissa's head like a headband. Maybe Grandma won't notice!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,If only there was someone who could fix my doll.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Arthur:,Come on!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Ratburn:,"Rapunzel, you sure are accident-prone."

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Arthur:,"I was wondering if, er, maybe you could, er, um..."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Please, save this doll!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Ratburn:,Oh dear. It looks like she had quite an accident!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,Can you help her?
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Ratburn:,"Hm. This material really isn't too different than what I use on some of my puppets. Yes, I think I can. Let me take her to my workshop. Come by in a couple of hours."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Oh, thank you! Thank you! Gee, I don't think you're scary at all!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Ratburn:,Huh?

3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,What have you done to my grandmother's doll?! Huh?
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Ratburn:,I was working on a new desk. Note the six-compartment separator for graded paper. And here... is your doll.
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Mr. Ratburn:,"What do you think, D.W.?"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,She's perfect!
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"Here she is, Grandma!"
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Grandma Thora:,"Why, she almost looks prettier than when I lent her to you! You took good care of her."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Grandma Thora:,"Arthur, you were going to let me read that A-plus report of yours."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,"I confess! I broke Clarissa, and Arthur's teacher, who's really nice and not scary like Arthur says, fixed her. But it's wrong to lie, so I'm telling you. Even though you'll never trust me again and... That's all. I'm done."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,"D.W., Clarissa's broken many times over the years, and I've had her fixed, just like you did."
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,D.W.:,Really?
3,Clarissa is Cracked/Transcript,24,Thora:,"Your getting her repaired shows that not only are you trustworthy, but you're also very responsible."

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,What's wrong with a cat?

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,D.W.:,Hey! My cookie!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,I suppose that shows how smart Pal is.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Of course. Pal is helping D.W. learn that she shouldn't leave food lying around.

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,It sounds vicious.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,"No, it was playing. We had fun."
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Brain:,A sense of self-respect and an ability to plan strategy. It does sound intelligent.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"No, it doesn't! It's stupid. All cats are stupid."
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,Have you ever even known a cat?
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,I don't have to. I know I don't like them.

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Buster:,I think there must be good cats in the world.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"No! There are no good cats! They bite kids' ears, remember?"
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Buster:,Maybe the cat eating the boy's ear was one of those made-up stories. Like the one about the teenagers who got a hook in their bucket of fried chicken.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Aww. Can't we have one minute without someone talking about stupid cats?
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,I can't believe Francine likes a stupid cat. What if she gets more?

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Pal doesn't need any cats for friends. I'm his friend.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Arg! What's he doing?!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,That's a very normal cat reaction.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,"Look, they're playing."

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Buster:,Pal looks fine to me.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,"He's just being brave for us. Inside, he's scared and upset."

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Oh no.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,Mom's taking him over to the vet for a check-up.
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Binky:,Wow! He walks on a leash? That's pretty cool. He's like a dog!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,He's not like a dog at all!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,Arthur's right. He's like himself. He's unique!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Brain:,He also must be hungry because he just ate Arthur's sandwich!

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Why are you rewarding him? He just ate my sandwich!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,Maybe he's teaching you not to leave your food lying around!

3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Augh!!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,"You obviously didn't mean what you said about not bringing Nemo. Underneath, you and Pal like him. You just don't realize it yet."
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,"Do you think we should study for the math test first, or spelling?"
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,Augh! Francine! Get him off Pal!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,Why?
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Arthur:,He'll hurt him!
3,Francine and the Feline/Transcript,26,Francine:,He will not! Nemo wouldn't hurt anyone.

3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Mr. Read:,"Hear me out on this. In other words, the more hands you had, the easier the work became."
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,It does sound kind of cool.
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Mr. Read:,That's the spirit. It'll go more than twice as fast. Trust me. So why don't you two start on Arthur's room first?
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,Wait a minute!
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,D.W.:,What?! His room?!

3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Mr. Read:,I'll take care of it.
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Mr. Read:,"Look, Arthur, it's very simple. The less time you spend fighting with D.W., the faster you'll get to the park. Right?"

3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Mr. Read:,The important thing is to try to work together. That's the only way this will work.
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,How can we work together when she won't let me put things away?
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,D.W.:,Can I say something?
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Mrs. Read:,"Arthur, D.W. helped you clean your room, so now it's up to you to return the favor."

3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,"D.W., are you sure you don't need any help?"
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,D.W.:,"No. First of all, you have cooties. Second of all, I think you'd be sad if you didn't go to the park. And third of all, you have cooties."
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,Thanks.
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,Yahoo! Whee! Yeah!

3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,It was all D.W.’s fault. She… Well… I guess it’s kind of my fault. I hadn’t cleaned my room for a while.
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Brain:,"I’ve done that too. One time, my mom wouldn’t let me do any extra credit projects until I cleaned it up."
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Buster:,Why can’t I have your mom?
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Mr. Frensky:,"Hey, nice of you kids to stick around. You know what they say: “Many hands make light work”."
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Buster:,Cool.
3,Arthur and D.W. Clean Up/Transcript,29,Arthur:,It's not what you think.

3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Ever have one of those days when it feels like time is passing really slowly?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"Is it just me? I mean, only two seconds have gone by, but it feels like a lot longer, doesn't it? The second hand moves again. Okay. Three seconds. Big whoop. Has this ever happened to you? Am I bored? No. I know what bored feels like."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur ):,That's like when D.W. watches Mary Moo Cow.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Eugh!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Mary Moo Cow ):,"Three fuzzy, cuddly, kitties. Three! Let's count them again. One, two, three."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,That reminds me! There's a hockey game on Channel 3.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,D.W.:,No! Mom! Arthur's trying to change the channel when the baby's watching the educational show that's good for her brains!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Mary Moo Cow ):,"Let's count them one more time. One, two, three fuzzy, cuddly kitties. Three. Three."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,That's boring. So what is this? What's happening to me?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,I thought school was never gonna end today. It felt like time stood still. What's wrong with me?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,"Maybe it's an alien-influenced distortion interdimensional distortion of the time-space continuum. That's the next big thing, you know."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,"It's so obvious what's wrong, but boys are too thick to know."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,What? What is it?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,You're in love.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,What?! I... Don't be... That's just wrong! Uh-uh! You don't know what you're talking about!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,Tell me who it is and you'll feel better.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,I am not in love.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,Say the name. Say the name!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Get away from me!

3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,"Psst! Hey, Arthur, I know exactly what's wrong with you."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,You do?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,"Here, have my apple. My mom says lack of roughage can make you cranky like that. An apple's a good source of roughage."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,I don't even know what that means. And I'm not cranky!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,"A big bowl of oatmeal's good too! Keep trying, girls. I got all day."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Brain:,"It's not just you, Arthur. I felt it too. Lately I haven't even wanted to double-check my sums."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Muffy:,And I haven't had the energy to go shopping!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,"Now, that I think about it, I haven't even felt like eating."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur+Brain+Muffy:,)
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Brain:,"It's like the whole world's messed up, or something."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,We have to figure out what's happening to everyone. Remember how happy we used to be?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Yeah. You know what was great? That TV special.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,‘Hairy Mary's Scary Hairy Halloween-o-rama Boo’!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Another great show was ‘A Blunderbuss Thanksgiving’.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,And what about ‘The Kid Who Got Clothes for Christmas’?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,That was one of the saddest shows I ever saw. ) It was great!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,That's it! That's what wrong with us!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,We're not sad enough?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"No. Those were holiday shows, but there hasn't been a holiday in a long time."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Muffy:,"Yeah. No preparations, no special store displays, no seasonal songs."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"No days off from school, no assemblies, no decorations."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,"And it's cold out so you can't really go anywhere, and the sun goes down early. It's like being dead, only with homework!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,You know what we need?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Less homework!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Er... no. We need to invent a new holiday!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,"I told my mom your idea. She says if we think of a good one, she'll print it in the paper and maybe it'll become a for-real holiday."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,That's great! Er... Do you understand this movie?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Uh-uh.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Me neither. Let's go tell everyone.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Why do you want to tell everyone that we don't understand the movie?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,No! We'll tell them about creating a new holiday.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Oh. That's a much better idea.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,"Arthur, that is the greatest idea you ever had! I bet we could think of a perfect holiday."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Kids:,Yeah!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Anybody got one yet?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Maybe this isn't gonna be as easy as I thought.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Brain:,Let's approach this logically. What are the ingredients of a holiday?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Celebrating an important event.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Presents!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,Relaxing. Having a day off from everything.

3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"Like a battle, or the biggest thing that ever happened or something."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Grandma Thora:,"When I was a girl, everyone was very excited when the Graf Zeppelin flew over the town."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur ):,Was there a big battle?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Grandma Thora ):,"No, it just flew over. It was very quiet."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Little Thora:,Hot ziggety!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"Not that that's not exciting, but I need something cool enough to be a brand-new holiday."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,D.W.:,Pony Day!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,I don't think so.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,D.W.:,People would love Pony Day. Just saying it is fun. Pony Day! Pony Day! Pony Day!

3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster ):,"On Give Me Candy Day, everyone dresses up in fun, colorful costumes and rings my doorbell."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine ):,"You mean, just like Halloween?"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster ):,No. They don't ring every doorbell. Just my doorbell. Then they give me candy. It's a holiday about giving.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur ):,About giving to you!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster ):,"No, because after I've eaten all I can, I share the rest with all the little children!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,"Great, huh?"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,"It would be. Only, my idea's much better. A holiday should be about relaxing."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,Eating candy is relaxing.

3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,"I knew you'd love it. So, let's get it in the paper and make it a holiday."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,That's better than ‘Give Me Candy Day’? I don't think so.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,"Holidays are about relaxing and having fun, remember?"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,They're also about something. Not nothing. That was about nothing!

3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Er...
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,"Psst! Hey, Arthur. About this whole holiday scheme."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"It's not a scheme, Binky. It's an honest attempt to do something worthwhile."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,"Blah-blah-blah, right. Whatever it is, a holiday needs one thing. Fireworks!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky ):,"As soon as midnight hits, we have 24 hours of solid, nonstop fireworks!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur ):,But you can't have fireworks during the day.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky ):,"So what? With nonstop fireworks, we wouldn't be able to hear Mr. Ratburn!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur ):,Couldn't that hurt our ears?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky ):,"Heh heh, yeah!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,"Think about it, my man."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Muffy:,"Arthur, I don't care what the holiday is. I just wanna sell the T-shirts and souvenirs. Just sign here to make me the official seller of staff."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Arr! We don't even have a holiday yet and already it's too commercial! I'm calling a meeting.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,No Homework Week!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Brain:,Have a Big Potato Night!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Fern:,Every Answer is Correct Day!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Muffy:,"These are all great ideas. If we just put all our ideas together, we'll have the greatest holiday of all!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,But what's it about? Taking gifts? TV specials? Cheap songs? Parades? Fireworks? T-shirts? That's not what a holiday's really about.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,I never heard of a holiday that didn't have that stuff.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"Well, sure, but that's extra. Isn't it still your birthday even if you don't get cake presents."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,We should use our holiday to honor something or someone who we think is really important.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,"I think, Arthur's right! Even if it means I don't get a lot of candy."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Brain:,Let's start working really hard to come up with a great holiday!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Kids:,)
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,It's hard to believe this all started because Arthur was acting like he was in love.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Muffy:,"Love? Oh, no!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Muffy:,It's almost Valentine's Day. I haven't bought any Valentines yet.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Francine:,"Me neither! We’ve been so busy, I completely forgot!"
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Wait! Hold it! Where are you going?!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Buster:,The dry spell is over. It's a holiday! I've gotta go buy candy hearts.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,Arthur! Have you seen the paper?
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,D.W.:,I sent in my idea about Pony Day. Mommy wrote it up. And they put it in the paper!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,Hey! It was real cool how you got everybody excited when we were in the dumps. Everybody forgot there were no special days.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,But I didn't think up a new holiday.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,Now you've got a whole year to think of one.
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,You're right!
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,"Here. Happy Garshmulter, Arthur."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,What??
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,That's my name for it. And there'll be fireworks all day and night and...
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Arthur:,"Well, we'll need something more than just fireworks."
3,"The Long, Dull Winter/Transcript",30,Binky:,Free soft pretzels! Picture a sky full of fireworks and soft pretzels!

Arthur: ""Dog""! ""The Red Dog,"" okay? Got it?! And stop being so noisy! See the sign? It says, ""No talking.""
D.W.: If I can't read ""The Red Dog,"" how do you expect me to read that sign?
Arthur: Well... just go pester someone else—I'm busy. [D.W. does so] Where was I? Oh, yeah—all you need to do to get a library card is...

Arthur: Except on days when I have to bring D.W.
D.W.: What does this word say? [points at a word on a book]
Arthur: ""The."" [D.W. walks away] Another great thing about the library is I can check out all these books!

Arthur: D.W.! [Binky gasps, closes the book and puts another book on top of it] Stop bugging Binky! It's time for your puppet show in the kids' section.
D.W.: I wasn't bugging him. Binky was reading to me about Chopin: the great romantic composer.
Binky: No, I wasn't. Uh, his name was Choppin' [shows Arthur the cover of the book Kicking Koalas with a man on it] and he was a karate master. [to D.W.] You weren't listening!

Binky: No, I wasn't. Uh, his name was Choppin' [shows Arthur the cover of the book Kicking Koalas with a man on it] and he was a karate master. [to D.W.] You weren't listening!
Arthur: Sorry if my sister was bothering you. [grabs D.W.'s arm]
Binky: It's okay. Little kids should hear about important stuff—like karate. [Arthur walks away with D.W. Binky opens the book he was reading to D.W. and continues reading it. D.W. spots a book]

Arthur:  Hopalong the Frog? Forget it! [hands the book back to D.W.]
D.W.: But it's about frogs. Please, please, please, please, please?

D.W.: Ms. Turner didn't say that you have to read to take out books—you just have to write your full name.
Arthur: You can't do that either!
D.W.: I know. But I'm gonna learn. You'll see."
4,D.W.'s Library Card (episode)/Transcript,1,Tommy Tibble:,"[reading a book called Chopin to D.W.] And he published a ""Rondo in C Minor"" when he was only 15 years old!
Arthur: D.W.! [Binky gasps, closes the book and puts another book on top of it] Stop bugging Binky! It's time for your puppet show in the kids' section.
D.W.: I wasn't bugging him. Binky was reading to me about Chopin: the great romantic composer.
Binky: No, I wasn't. Uh, his name was Choppin' [shows Arthur the cover of the book Kicking Koalas with a man on it] and he was a karate master. [to D.W.] You weren't listening!
Arthur: Sorry if my sister was bothering you. [grabs D.W.'s arm]
Binky: It's okay. Little kids should hear about important stuff—like karate. [Arthur walks away with D.W. Binky opens the book he was reading to D.W. and continues reading it. D.W. spots a book]
D.W.: Ooh! [takes the book off the shelf] Arthur, look! A book on frogs!! Take it out for me? [shows it to Arthur]
Arthur:  Hopalong the Frog? Forget it! [hands the book back to D.W.]
D.W.: But it's about frogs. Please, please, please, please, please?
Arthur: I can't take out baby books on my library card. It could go on my permanent record.

Paige Turner: Sorry, Arthur, the last book you took out was Hopalong the Frog! From now on, you can only take out baby books! [echoing] Baby books! Baby books! Baby books!
(While the words ""Baby books"" echo, she presses a red button on the desk and arms come out of the front of the desk to dress up Arthur as a baby)
Francine and Muffy: [off-camera] Arthur's a baby! Arthur's a baby!
(Two robotic arms come out from the front of the desk to take a picture of Arthur while Francine and Muffy are teasing him. He stops dreaming and puts the book back on the shelf)
Arthur: Sorry, D.W., there's just... too much at stake.
D.W.: Yeah? Well, someday I'm gonna get my own library card [Arthur looks shocked] then I'll take out whatever I want. [walks away]
(Scene cuts to Mr. Ratburn finishing a puppet show. All of the kids cheer. Mr. Ratburn walks from behind the stage)
Paige Turner: Thank you. [Mr. Ratburn bows] Are there any questions?
D.W.: [raises her hand] When will we be old enough to get our own library cards?
Paige Turner: You are old enough, D.W.
D.W.: I am?! I'll take one... No, make that two! I want more cards than Arthur!! [the rest of the kids shout ""I want one!""]
Paige Turner: Settle down, children. You can all have one. You just have to be able to write your full name. [D.W.'s jaw drops]
D.W.: I knew there was a catch!
Timmy Tibble: We can write our names!
D.W.: But my full name is Dora Winifred Read. I hardly ever say it. How can I write it?!
Tommy Tibble: You have it easy! Be glad you're not Aloysius Zimmerplotz. [points to Aloysius Zimmerplotz trying to write his full name on a piece of paper]
Aloysius Zimmerplotz: Oh, no! I ran out of room again. [crumples up the piece of paper. Scene cuts to D.W. and Arthur walking home from the library]
