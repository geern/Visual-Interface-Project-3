4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, [at the library] I love the library! There are so many books to read and great things to find out. But the best thing about the library is... [whispers] it's quiet.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Arthur!!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, Except on days when I have to bring D.W.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., What does this word say? [points at a word on a book]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," ""The."" [D.W. walks away] Another great thing about the library is I can check out all these books!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Arthur!!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, What is it now?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., What does this word say?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," ""Red."" [D.W. walks away] To take books out at the library, you need a library card. But it's easy to get one of those. All you have to do is..."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., ARTHUR!!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, What?!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., How about this word?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," ""Dog""! ""The Red Dog,"" okay? Got it?! And stop being so noisy! See the sign? It says, ""No talking."""
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," If I can't read ""The Red Dog,"" how do you expect me to read that sign?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," Well... just go pester someone else—I'm busy. [D.W. does so] Where was I? Oh, yeah—all you need to do to get a library card is..."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W," Shh! [whispers] The sign says, ""No talking""!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Francine,"  [title card]  ""D.W.'s Library Card."""
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Binky," [reading a book called Chopin to D.W.] And he published a ""Rondo in C Minor"" when he was only 15 years old!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," D.W.! [Binky gasps, closes the book and puts another book on top of it] Stop bugging Binky! It's time for your puppet show in the kids' section."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., I wasn't bugging him. Binky was reading to me about Chopin: the great romantic composer.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Binky," No, I wasn't. Uh, his name was Choppin' [shows Arthur the cover of the book Kicking Koalas with a man on it] and he was a karate master. [to D.W.] You weren't listening!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, Sorry if my sister was bothering you. [grabs D.W.'s arm]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Binky, It's okay. Little kids should hear about important stuff—like karate. [Arthur walks away with D.W. Binky opens the book he was reading to D.W. and continues reading it. D.W. spots a book]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Ooh! [takes the book off the shelf] Arthur, look! A book on frogs!! Take it out for me? [shows it to Arthur]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur,  Hopalong the Frog? Forget it! [hands the book back to D.W.]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," But it's about frogs. Please, please, please, please, please?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, I can't take out baby books on my library card. It could go on my permanent record.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Speaker, WARNING! READER IS A BABY! ADULT BOOKS ARE OFF LIMITS!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," Sorry, Arthur, the last book you took out was Hopalong the Frog! From now on, you can only take out baby books! [echoing] Baby books! Baby books! Baby books!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Francine and Muffy, [off-camera] Arthur's a baby! Arthur's a baby!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," Sorry, D.W., there's just... too much at stake."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Yeah? Well, someday I'm gonna get my own library card [Arthur looks shocked] then I'll take out whatever I want. [walks away]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner, Thank you. [Mr. Ratburn bows] Are there any questions?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., [raises her hand] When will we be old enough to get our own library cards?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," You are old enough, D.W."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," I am?! I'll take one... No, make that two! I want more cards than Arthur!! [the rest of the kids shout ""I want one!""]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," Settle down, children. You can all have one. You just have to be able to write your full name. [D.W.'s jaw drops]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., I knew there was a catch!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Timmy Tibble, We can write our names!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., But my full name is Dora Winifred Read. I hardly ever say it. How can I write it?!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Tommy Tibble, You have it easy! Be glad you're not Aloysius Zimmerplotz. [points to Aloysius Zimmerplotz trying to write his full name on a piece of paper]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Aloysius Zimmerplotz," Oh, no! I ran out of room again. [crumples up the piece of paper. Scene cuts to D.W. and Arthur walking home from the library]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," And when I have my own library card, I'm gonna get Hopalong the Frog and you can't do anything about it!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, But you can't read!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Ms. Turner didn't say that you have to read to take out books—you just have to write your full name.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, You can't do that either!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., I know. But I'm gonna learn. You'll see.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," ""Doba Minifred Reabed""? [the two ""B""s are capitalized and written backwards, and the ""W"" is upside down] Who's that?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," I can't do it! [puts her head on the table. Scene cuts to the Read family eating lunch. D.W. is picking at her mashed potatoes with a fork] There are too many letters in my name. Why didn't you name me something simple, like A?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Jane," You seem to have ""Dora Winifred"" down. [the words ""Dora Winifred"" are written on D.W.'s mashed potatoes]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Quick, Dad! More mashed potatoes! [David puts more mashed potatoes on D.W.'s plate. She writes ""Read""] I wrote my name. I wrote my name! Look out, world, D.W. Read WRITES!!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," ""Dora Winifred... Read."" ""Dora Winifred Read."" [the words ""Dora Winifred Read"" are written twice on the piece of paper. The Tibbles walk by with their library cards]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Tommy Tibble, I bet D.W. messes up her name and doesn't get her library card!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Timmy Tibble," Yeah, she can't even spell ""D""!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," I can, too! I've already spelled it 100 times!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Jane, It's time to get in line. [D.W. gets in line.]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., What if the Tibbles are right? What if I forget my own name? What is my name? I forgot it! I forgot my name!!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Jane," Good luck, D.W.!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Oh, yeah—D.W. But what does that stand for? I can't remember! [it is her turn now. Paige Turner hands her a pencil. She tries writing her full name. She hands Paige Turner the card. She reads it]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," Very nice. ""Dora Winifred Read."" Here's your card! [hands D.W. her library card. She smiles]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Look, Arthur, [runs over to Arthur] you didn't think I could do it, but I did it! And now I can take out any book I want! [gets an evil look on her face] Now I know what true power feels like! [scene cuts to Arthur and D.W. walking. D.W. runs to the shelf where Hopalong the Frog is but it's not there] Hey, [picks up two books] where's Hopalong the Frog? It was here just a couple of days ago!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," It's probably back on the shelves. Ask for it at the front desk. [there is a sign that says ""The front desk"" with an arrow pointing to the front desk. Scene cuts to D.W. at the front desk. She has crossed arms while tapping her left foot. Paige Turner checks for Hopalong the Frog on her computer]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," Sorry, that book was just checked out. It should be back a week from today."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., A whole week?! I can't wait that long!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," It could come back before then, but Saturday is when it's due."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Jane," Come on, D.W.! [she and Arthur walk to the exit]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Okay... [walks to the exit too. She runs back] Is it back yet?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner, Nope.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., [walks to the exit again. She runs back again] How about now?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," Uh-uh. [D.W. walks to the exit again. Scene cuts to Paige Turner running to answer the phone. She answers it] No, it's not in yet. [hangs up. Scene cuts to her taking a bite out of a sandwich. Her computer beeps]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Computer," You've got mail! [The computer says, ""You've got mail."" Paige Turner types something and sends it to the computer in the Read house.]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Jane, Not yet D.W. [D.W. growls angrily. Scene cuts to D.W. in her pajamas at the window waiting for Paige Turner. She walks up to the Read house]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," [shouts] Not yet, D.W.! [walks away. D.W. frowns. Scene cuts to D.W. in Arthur's room]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," What if Saturday never comes? [climbs on his bed] What if we go right from Friday to Sunday? Are there leap weeks like leap years, Arthur?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," Relax, it's only 12 hours away. Now let me sleep. [scene cuts to the morning]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Wake up, Arthur! [tries to wake Arthur up by shaking him] Tomorrow is today and today is yesterday!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, [wakes up] Huh?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., It's SATURDAY!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, [stammers] But it's... [checks his alarm clock] 6:30! The library isn't even open yet!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., I know. [grabs something] But we have to be the first ones there. [gives Arthur his breakfast] Here's your cereal. [Arthur gets a bored look on his face.]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., But it has to be here! You said Hopalong the Frog was due today!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner, But it might be late.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Late?! Call the police!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, Why don't you just take out some other baby book?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., I want HOPALONG THE FROG! And it's NOT a baby book!!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," Well, I'm not gonna spend my whole Saturday here!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Fine! Go home! I'll just tell Mommy that you left me here ALL ALONE! [Arthur stops dead in his tracks. He growls angrily. Scene cuts to him sitting on a couch snoring with a book on his lap and D.W. spying behind a bookshelf. She spots Aloysius Zimmerplotz returning a book. She gasps. She wakes Arthur up]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, Huh?!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Arthur, look! Somebody's returning a big book! [runs over to Aloysius Zimmerplotz] This might be it! [She holds up her library card like a police ID] The name's Dora Winifred Read. Is that a book on frogs?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Aloysius Zimmerplotz," Uh, no. [holds up the book he's returning] It's Chippy the Choo-Choo."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Oh... [starts walking back to Arthur] it'll never come.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Tommy and Timmy Tibble," Hi, D.W.!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., [gasps when she sees that Tommy Tibble is carrying the book] YOU had the book! I should've known! Aah!! You hurt it! It's all wrinkly!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner, [Tommy Tibble gives the book to her] It was like that when they took it out. It's an old book.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Timmy Tibble, We would never hurt a library book.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Tommy Tibble," If you do, they'll take away your library card forever!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., [gives Paige Turner her library card] Really? [Paige Turner puts a yellow piece of paper in a slot in the book and scans it. She gives it to D.W.]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner, Here you go! Take good care of it! [D.W. looks shocked]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Timmy Tibble, [whispers to Tommy Tibble] Or else! [both Tommy and Timmy Tibble start laughing. D.W. starts dreaming]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., [rubbing her hands together wearing a red jacket] I've been waiting so long for this moment! [opens the book but the cover comes off. She gasps. She puts the cover back on but screams as the book crumbles up and turns into a cyclone] What have I done?!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Paige Turner," [the cyclone takes D.W. to the library] You can never have another library card again! [stamps a big red ""X"" on D.W.'s library card. There are stalactites hanging from the ceiling]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," [is standing at the desk the height of a judge's podium. The floor is made of wood, not carpeting] But I worked so hard for that card!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Tommy and Timmy Tibble, [walk along with a stack of books in their hands] More books for us! More books for us!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, [laughs evilly] I told you'd never have a library card! I TOLD you! [continues to laugh evilly]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., It's not fair! [falls to her knees and sobs] It's not fair! [stops dreaming]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," [walks in her room] I know you're just gonna bug me all night to read you that book, so let's get it over with now."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," NO! [Arthur is about to take the book but D.W. moves it away from him] I mean... you've done enough for me already, Arthur. [puts it down on her bed] Maybe later."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, Huh? 
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, You forgot what today is!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," No, I didn't. It's Saturday!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, You're supposed to return your library book today!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., [drops her spoon] It's today?! I thought it would never come! [runs out of the kitchen and in her room. She gets a box and puts it on her bed. She takes the cover off and an object is wrapped up in her blankie. She takes it out and unwraps it. The object is Hopalong the Frog. She runs to kitchen and gets oven mitts. She picks up the book. Arthur walks in]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, Why are you wearing oven mitts?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., To keep the book safe!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," It's a book, D.W.-- it's not going to explode! How was it anyway?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., I don't know! I never opened it. I was afraid I'd lose my library card.
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, Why would you lose your library card?
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.," Because the Tibbles said if you hurt a book, they take away your library card forever! And look at it, Arthur. [holds up the book] It's an old book. It could fall apart any minute!"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," I'll open it, if you're so worried. [walks over to the book and takes it. He opens it] Hey! I took this book out! See, that's my name. [shows D.W. the slot inside the book that says ""H 201.1."" The yellow piece of paper has the same thing written on it. It has the names Diana Smith, Arthur Read, and Mona Dorey listed on it] You used to have to write your name here whenever you took a book out. This is the very first book I ever took out of the library! [imagines about him taking out the book when he is little]"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Little Arthur, [without glasses] My first book! My first book! [he disappears]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., You took out a baby book?!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," It isn't a baby book! I love this book! It's great for little kids. Here, listen to this: [sits on D.W.'s bed and D.W. crawls behind him] ""Hopalong the Frog hopped onto a log. And the log started floating away... [Arthur finishes the book] The end."" [D.W. starts crying] What's wrong, D.W.? It was a happy story. Didn't you like it?"
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., [crying] I loved it. I'm just sad I have to return it now! [blows her nose into her right oven mitt]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur," Yeah, but you can take it right out again. [gives the book to D.W.] It's called renewing a book."
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W.,  [gasps] I can?!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., Arthur's gonna read it to me every single day! Twice a day! [Paige Turner scans it] Once in the morning and once at night! And then I'm gonna renew it [Paige Turner gives the book to her] again and again and again and again and again... [Arthur smacks his forehead]
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,Arthur, What have I done?!
4,D.W.'s Library Card,1,D.W., ...and again and again and again! [the episode ends]
